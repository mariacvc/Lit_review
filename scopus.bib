	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from motor vehicles is a one of major contributing factors to global warming. Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions should involve all parties including universities. In 2017, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) has committed to reduce CO2 emissions from its campus upon joining the low-carbon campus initiative. Thus, the current study aims to estimate the baseline of on-campus vehicle CO2 emissions by using mobility analysis of 5,294 entry vehicle data from two main gates (West and East) and 15 parking zones in the campus. Parking volume observations and traffic assignment analysis using the Bureau of Public Roads functions were undertaken to determine the links’ volumes. Subsequently, vehicle CO2 emissions were derived from the estimated vehicle fuel consumption. The results reveal that a total of 1,333.4 kg of CO2 emissions were expelled by on-campus motorised vehicle movements (which were predominantly petrol cars that comprised 80% of the observed vehicle trips). Additionally, the study discovered that the average on-campus vehicle CO2 emission was 12.4 kg per kilometre which far exceeds the European Standard for road traffic CO2 emissions. Thus, to achieve the status of a low-carbon campus, it is imperative for the university management to properly address Sector 3 CO2 emissions from the transportation segment by employing effective strategies and policies to significantly reduce private vehicle dependency among university staff and students. © Penerbit UMT},

	abstract = {Technological change is one of the most effective methods to reduce carbon intensity. Meanwhile, cities are essential carriers of technological change and carbon emissions. Considering the extensive land expansion in urbanization which always manifests in the density of urban economic activity, this paper analyzes the relationship between urban density and carbon intensity and also the mediating role of directed technological change to explore the interaction among them. First, the authors construct a theoretical model that considers the knowledge production sector, final goods production sector, and technical choice. Second, based on the panel data of 280 cities in China from 2008 to 2017, the authors use the two-way fixed effect regression, mediation-effect regression, and panel-threshold model to examine the results. The results show that: (1) The increase in urban density helps to reduce carbon intensity. (2) Capital-saving technological change is a mediating factor in the path of urban density's effect on carbon intensity. (3) With the increase in market size, the effect of urban density on capital-saving technological change weakens, thereby weakening the inhibitory effect on carbon intensity. Findings can provide a reference for reducing carbon intensity in other countries to formulate reasonable and practical policies for sustainable urbanization, especially for developing countries. © 2022 The Authors},

This area is referred to as a Ramsar Site, a designation given to areas with special protection statuses, since it is the largest natural waste recycling system in the world. The site faces many threats to its biodiversity and ecosystem functioning due to anthropogenic activity in the region, and therefore an assessment of the ecosystem services, bio-ecological uniqueness, and issues stemming from climate change and human impacts is needed to develop protection strategies for the future ecological functioning and sustainability of the wetlands. The authors use GIS and remote sensing techniques to assess and monitor harmful industrial and environmental impacts on the wetlands, and to inform mitigation and conservation strategies in the face of ongoing threats such as pollution, habitat destruction and bioinvasion. The book also highlights various social and economic aspects tied to the functioning and management of the wetlands, along with ecological, biological, and physio-chemical considerations. The study will be of use to students and researchers in aquatic ecology, biodiversity, and environmental sustainability and conservation, as well as to environmental planners, engineers, and policymakers. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {The environmental repercussions of extensive carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on the environment are crucial for policymakers and scholars. The repercussions of and connection between economic growth (ECG), tourism (TOUR), and foreign direct investment (FDI) on CO2 emission mitigation have been measured and argued from empirical and theoretical perspectives by scholars. Notwithstanding, the extant body of knowledge has failed to incorporate and investigate the function of governance in decarbonizing tourism activities and FDI from CO2 emissions to attain a healthy and quality environment in Africa. Hence, this current research investigates governance’s role in the reduction processes of CO2 emissions grounded in environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) conceptual assumptions for panel data spanning 2000 through 2020 for 27 African countries. This research utilized the Westerlund panel cointegration approach for the investigation of the cointe-gration of the selected variables. This study applied the Driscoll–Kraay regression approach for the long-term estimation. In addition, the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and the pooled mean group (PMG) were used for robustness checks. The findings of this research indicated that the governance (GOV) indicators employed have a statistically significant effect on the CO2 emission re-duction. Besides, this study found that the appreciation of the income of the nations gives credence to the formation of the EKC theory and contributes to the decline in CO2 emissions within the selected African nations. The findings revealed that tourism, FDI, ECG, and GOV are positive and significant factors leading to increased CO2 emissions in Africa. Furthermore, the results showed that effective governance and control of FDI inflows and tourism activities can support decarboni-zation. These findings suggest the merits of governance in ensuring effective decarbonization policies of the environment, and policy suggestions are accordingly put forward. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Policy Points The commercial determinants of health (CDoH) concept, which currently focuses on markets that harm health, should be expanded to refer to the interface between commerce and health, which can sometimes have positive public health consequences. The regulatory stances framework helps us classify public health preferences for regulating specific markets related to CDoH, based on the intended effects of regulations on market size. The regulatory stances a jurisdiction can adopt can be classified as ranging from prohibitionist through contractionist, permissive, and expansionist, to universalist. The regulatory stances framework increases the usefulness of the CDoH concept by expanding the conversation beyond negative determinants of health and providing a fuller view of the tools at the disposal of society to alter markets and improve health. Context: The effects of commerce on the public health are omnipresent. The commercial determinants of health (CDoH) represent a burgeoning area of scholarly debate and activist policymaking to redress markets that adversely affect public health. The CDoH debate is a logical extension of the tobacco control movement, but, to its detriment, the CDoH conversation remains primarily focused policies and proposals that are analogous to historical tobacco control strategies. Methods: This paper argues that for the CDoH to develop further and broaden its appeal, it should expand to cover markets with conditional and positive impacts on health. To explain and order this conversation, a comparative framework for regulatory policy is introduced: the regulatory stances. The regulatory stances classify a regulatory policy based on the intended effect of policy on the size of a market in the future relative to the present. Findings: Some markets that interface between commerce and health do not inherently harm health. Regulatory policy toward these markets should be different in intent than regulatory policy for markets with negative health effects. Conclusions: By using the regulatory stances framework to encompass markets that have positive or conditional effects on health as well as those that have adverse health effects, the CDoH conversation can shift away from the exclusive focus on strategies to shrink markets with adverse health impacts to consider a wider array of policy options. © 2022 Milbank Memorial Fund.},

In this review, we investigate the minimalist lifestyle to find out if minimalism could deliver the dual benefit of reduced carbon emissions and increased wellbeing. Minimalists have voluntarily chosen to have few possessions, despite economic and social structures that encourage consumption. Having fewer possessions suggests they might have a lower carbon emissions. A review of three other low-consumption lifestyles: frugalism, tightwadism and voluntary simplicity, offers some support for this hypothesis, but the empirical evidence regarding minimalism is scant. We also review minimalist motivations, finding some support for a positive association between wellbeing and minimalism. We conclude that while minimalism might offer wellbeing benefits, research on carbon emissions is inconclusive. Furthermore, even if minimalism did result in reduced emissions, the minimalist lifestyle maybe too individualistic to create social change.

	abstract = {The construction industry’s inherent fragmentation fuels Construction Supply Chain (CSC) complexity. Logistics form an essential part of the CSC in terms of costs and project management. In turn, transportation accounts for more than half the logistics costs due to construction materials being low-cost/high-volume, and most other logistics processes being business processes and not physical ones. Construction transport is almost entirely road bound, one of the least sustainable modes with externalities far out of proportion to its numbers. Ergo, its optimisation presents substantial greening (de-carbonisation) opportunity, with potentially far-reaching sustainability impacts. The ASI (Avoid-Shift-Improve) concept considers activity, modal structure, and energy intensity/efficiency as transport carbon components, providing a fundamental optimisation framework. 93% of New Zealand’s freight (a third of it construction related) is road bound, with 99% fossil-fuel (diesel) dependence. Government adoption of ASI elements viz Supply Chain (SC) efficiency, transport optimisation, data/information sharing, and collaboration for transport decarbonisation aligns with Industry 5.0, but seeks further research for concrete implementation pathways. This paper aims to bridge the gap by proposing a research framework for greening of construction transport as a sustainability enabler for New Zealand.

	abstract = {Agricultural product trade openness is a crucial factor impacting agricultural carbon emissions. This study analyzes the relationship between trade openness and carbon emissions in China. Using panel data from 2002 to 2020 for 31 provinces, a threshold panel model is employed to examine the non-linear relationship from an environmental regulation perspective. The findings reveal a significant single-threshold effect of environmental regulation. When environmental regulation intensity is low, trade openness is positively associated with agricultural carbon emissions. However, when environmental regulation intensity is high, trade openness significantly reduces carbon emissions. Regional regression analysis indicates that this single-threshold effect holds true in major grain-producing, grain-selling, and grain- producing- selling balance areas, although regional differences exist. This study emphasizes the need to coordinate environmental regulations and trade policies, strengthen environmental control, and leverage the threshold effect of environmental regulation in reducing carbon emissions through agricultural product trade openness. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this research is to investigate the long-term nexus among trade liberalization, sea transportation, economic growth, energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by considering the EKC hypothesis for Mexico from 1980 to 2021. In this context, multiple regression, ADF, PP, FMOLS, Bayer-Hanck co-integration tests are employed in order to examine both the effect of independent variables on dependent variables and the long-run relationship. According to results of multiple regression, FMOLS analysis and Bayer-Hanck co-integration test, trade liberalization, sea transportation, economic growth, energy consumption have substantial impact on CO2 emissions and there is a long-run relationship among variables from 1980 to 2021 for Mexico which verifies the EKC hypothesis. All empirical evidence demonstrates that the Mexican government should take radical steps to prevent environmental degradation. The presence of trade liberalization and the positive movement of the ecological footprint reveal the increasing effect of growth on carbon dioxide emissions, especially in a developing country such as Mexico, which aims for more economic growth. All these indicate the necessity of switching to practices aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In this sense, incentives for renewable energy sources, rate differentiation in motor vehicle tax, and regulations in the tax system for negative externalities are some of the applications that can be done. In addition, public expenditures for green infrastructure such as low-carbon energy production and energy efficiency in public buildings can be increased, investments can be made in R&D studies to support innovation, and activities can be preferred to increase environmental awareness. Besides, there are various sea transport green solutions in order to reduce emissions and pollution in maritime transport. Green energy suggest solutions such as reducing the cruise speed of the ship, reducing the use of fossil fuels, choosing new generation fuel types with cleaner content, increasing energy efficiency, and making a weather-dependent cruise plan. © 2023, Econjournals.

	abstract = {A comprehensive framework is proposed for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in the field of commercial aviation (passengers and cargo), capable to ensure transparency and comparability when evaluating the overall environmental performances of four emerging aviation systems, i.e., biofuels, electrofuels, electric, and hydrogen. The projected global revenue passenger kilometer (RPK) and is suggested as the functional unit for two timeframes representing near-term (2035) and long-term (2045), and for two segments, namely domestic and international. To solve the difficulty of comparing liquid fuels and electric aviation, the framework proposes a methodology to translate projected RPK into energy requirements for each of the studied sustainable aviation systems. Generic system boundaries are defined with their key activities for all four systems, with the biofuel system being sub-divided into two categories to distinguish whether it stems from residual or land-dependent biomass. The activities are grouped in seven categories: (i) conventional (fossil-based) kerosene activity, (ii) conversion processes from feedstock supply (to fuel or energy production for aircraft operation), (iii) counterfactual uses of constrained resources and displacement effects associated to co-products management, (iv) aircraft manufacture, (v) aircraft operation, (vi) additional infrastructure needed, and (vii) end-of-life management (aircraft and batteries). Considering applying regulations, the framework also includes a methodology to handle: (i) hybridization (the use of more than one source of energy/propulsion system to power an aircraft), (ii) the mass penalty affecting the number of carried passengers in some of the systems, and (iii) impacts stemming from non-CO2 tailpipe emissions - aspects that are currently neglected in most LCA studies. The proposed framework builds upon the most recent knowledge in the field; however, some choices are dependent on upcoming scientific advances concerning e.g., tailpipe emissions at high altitude and their environmental impacts, new aircraft configuration, etc., and are subject to significant uncertainties. Overall, this framework provides a guideline for LCA practitioners addressing new energy sources for future aviation. © 2023},

	abstract = {Sustainable energy systems are sensitive to economic complexity, i.e., the combination of knowledge, innovation, and productivity, since it affects the countries' portfolio decisions of primary energy sources, shaping geopolitics, and contributing to global energy security. This research assesses the impact of economic complexity on the performance of two energy systems measurements, e.g., diversification of primary energy demand (D.P.E.D) and non-carbon-based fuel portfolio (N.C.F.P), controlling for energy intensity, energy prices, resource supply diversity, and CO2 emissions in a panel of 25 large energy-using countries during 1998–2018. The findings support the long-run and causal relationships across energy systems using the panel cointegration methods and dynamic panel models. Specifically, economic complexity's statistically significant and positive effect on D.P.E.D and N.C.F.P is detected. Moreover, the contribution of N.C.F.P to total energy demand is more elastic than D.P.E.D when the shares of economic complexity and the control variables increase. Results also indicate that the cyclical movements of economic complexity are not related to energy systems fluctuations across large energy-consuming economies. Consequently, the role of economic complexity in sustainable energy systems is a necessary condition to overcome the barriers in achieving (i) resource abundance and equitability and (ii) a non-carbon-based fuel portfolio for large energy consumers. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The most important challenge for both developed and developing countries is to ensure sustainability while struggling with environmental degradation. CO2 emissions as a proxy for environmental degradation can be considered an obstacle to sustainability. There exist several significant works in the literature on the effects of solar energy use on environmental degradation/sustainability. In this study, the effects of the use of solar energy within different time and frequency dimensions on CO2 emissions were examined with the methodology of the continuous wavelet transform. The paper investigated the association between solar energy consumption and total energy-related CO2 emissions in the USA through Morlet wavelet analysis, which is one of the most advanced time-frequency analysis methods for the period 1990:1–2022:6. In the wavelet coherency computations, geothermal energy consumption, hydroelectric energy consumption, industrial production, and manufacturing industry production variables were also included as control variables. Empirical findings demonstrate that solar energy consumption can have reducing effects on CO2 emissions at lower frequencies (longer-term cycles) and sub-time periods (2014:1–2022:1) in the USA. The findings can guide the energy and environmental policies of developed and developing countries that aim to struggle with global warming and/or climate change through the increase in solar energy usage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Also, global warming problems put large pressure on governments, individuals, and policymakers. Therefore, for reliable energy supply and economic development, the target of achieving a low-carbon and sustainable environment is needed. In this light, we explore the role of clean energy and technological innovation in carbon emission reduction in China from 1995 to 2018. The key outcomes from the fully modified least-squares and robust least-squares indicate an elasticity of −0.065 and −0.075, respectively, for the nexus of renewable energy and CO2 emissions. Similarly, nuclear energy, technology innovation, and political-institutional quality have a negative influence on CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the granger causality demonstrates feedback between renewable energy and CO2 emissions, as well as between technological innovation and CO2 emissions. To achieve a cleaner environment, the implementation of the existing policy pathways is potentially geared toward applying technological innovations to produce renewable energy at lower costs.

Our analysis reveals several key findings. Firstly, despite the absence of oil price volatility, the size of Malaysia's ecological footprint varies significantly over the study period. Secondly, energy prices contribute significantly to the ecological footprint. Thirdly, the association between energy prices and ecological footprint is stronger during periods of economic growth. Lastly, energy prices contribute to economic growth and inflation in the short run, but after factoring in the ecological footprint, the association extends into the long run. These findings suggest that Malaysia's economic growth is driven not only by energy prices but also by its ecological footprint. Moreover, the size of Malaysia's ecological footprint is driven by factors at the microeconomic level rather than energy prices alone. Therefore, the impact of energy prices on the macroeconomy, especially when considering the impact on the environment, is non-linear. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

I discuss factors associated with the adoption of pro-environmental behavior, as well as methodological limitations that should be addressed in future work. Recent Findings: Individual behavior drives a large proportion of total emissions, and lifestyle characteristics account for significant variability in individual carbon footprints. Yet behavior is difficult to change, and critics warn that “individualizing” climate action may be counterproductive. On average, interventions promoting pro-environmental behavior have produced small effects, though some promising approaches have emerged. Values matter, but strategies that modify social, informational, and structural conditions result in more impact. Summary: There is much that can be gained from a better understanding of the factors that drive environmentally significant behavior. To increase relevance, researchers should carefully consider the strengths and limitations of measures and pursue behavior-specific inquiries to complement generalized approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Global warming and the rapid depletion of natural assets have made many countries anxious to find green growth strategies, including global partnerships and international business. China has positioned itself as the right partner for sustainable growth and development in Africa through different engagement routes. In this study, we employ fixed effects on a sample of 27 countries over 17 years to examine the impact of China's foreign direct investment and trade on green growth in Africa. Our results show that China's investment and trade affect green growth differently. We find that foreign direct investment and export have a negative impact on green growth. Contrarily, we find importation from China to increase green growth. Our results suggest that the growing presence of China in Africa through direct investment and exportation of natural resources is likely to hamper achieving the Sustainable Development Growth goals. However, countries can harness some benefits from importing sustainable products from China. Our study extends the green growth literature and informs policymakers of the need to pay attention to the effects of growing Chinese-Africa engagement on attaining sustainable and greener growth. The results are robust to different identification techniques, including two-stage least square and system generalised method of movement. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {The Environmental Impact of Cities assesses the environmental impact that comes from cities and their inhabitants, demonstrating that our current political and economic systems are not environmentally sustainable because they are designed for endless growth in a system which is finite. It is already well documented that political, economic and social forces are capable of shaping cities and their expansion, retraction, gentrification, re- population, industrialisation or de- industrialisation. However, the links between these political and economic forces and the environmental impact they have on urban areas have yet to be numerically presented. As a result, it is not clear how our cities are affecting the environment, meaning it is currently impossible to relate their economic, political and social systems to their environmental performance. This book examines a broad selection of cities covering a wide range of political systems, geography, cultural backgrounds and population size. The environmental impact of the selected cities is calculated using both ecological footprint and carbon emissions, two of the most extensively available indices for measuring environmental impact. The results are then considered in terms of political, economic and social factors to ascertain the degree to which these factors are helping or hindering the reduction of the environmental impact of humans. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of sustainability, urban planning, urban design, environmental sciences, geography and sociology. © 2023 Fabricio Chicca, Brenda Vale and Robert Vale.

The five largest ports globally handle goods that embody >1.4% of global output, while 40 ports add >10% of domestic output of the economies they serve, predominantly small islands. We identify critical cross-border infrastructure dependencies for some landlocked and island countries that rely on specific ports outside their jurisdiction.

Nonetheless, despite the fact that transportation is an important component of the supply chain, its environmental consequences pose a severe threat to the ecosystem as a whole. As a result, we intend to explore the relationship between transportation, economy, and CO2 emissions. We used the Static method with Pooled OLS, then tested the Granger causality to validate the use of dynamic approach via the GMM system. The major findings revealed that GDP and trade openness had a considerable impact on CO2 emissions. Although the three modes of transportation have different effects on CO2 emissions, road density has a positive and considerable impact on CO2 emissions. The railway network is inversely connected to CO2 emissions. While the quantity of flight passengers has no substantial effect on emissions. In terms of the impulse response function, there is an initial shock in period 2 for the response of air passengers carried to CO2 emissions, followed by convergence back to zero in period 6, whereas road density has a slight decrease in period 2 with a post shock peak in period 4, followed by convergence back to zero in period 5. The variance decomposition results reveal a little increase until the fifth period for road density, air passengers, and trade openness with coefficients equal to 0.0893, 0.636, and 1.573, respectively, after which these three variables offer decreasing coefficients. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Most of the existing IRT application studies have been conducted on innovation resistance to technology or devices. This study focuses on consumer innovation resistance to zero-waste products, extending the theoretical application of IRT to the field of sustainability research. We further broaden this theory by exploring the moderating role of perceived environmental responsibility (PER). Data were collected from 400 consumers through an online survey. To verify the hypothesis, structural equation modeling (SEM) was carried out using AMOS software, and the moderating effect was verified using SPSS Process Macro Model 1. The results of the study suggest that usage, value, risk and tradition barriers significantly affect the adoption of zero-waste products. Furthermore, consumer PER shows antagonistic interactions with the barriers (usage, value, risk and tradition) and zero-waste product purchase intentions; as consumer PER increases, the impacts of the barriers on zero-waste product purchase intentions also increase. These results are expected to provide a theoretical framework for future IRT research and to enable fashion brands to implement effective zero-waste practices and to manage government and corporate barriers (image, usage, value, risk and tradition) with respect to zero-waste products, thereby reaping greater profits. © 2022 by the authors.},

Because of the rapid changes in consumer perceptions brought on by the COVID-19 epidemic, this study gives a thorough methodology for assessing the success of e-commerce businesses. The application’s twenty-five secondary standards include two sustainability elements, sustainable development, and carbon dioxide emissions. Three Indian e-commerce companies serve as a case study to illustrate the assessment methodology. To capture the uncertainty in the judicial process, the findings are achieved via multi-criteria judgment (MCDM) technique called fuzzy VIKOR. In addition, quantitative research is used to rate and compare e-commerce businesses in terms of how well it meets the needs of their customers.

This is partly because of the rebound effect (RE) where consumer behavior can absorb some of or all the energy efficiency gains. Time savings from time-efficient technologies can intensify energy consumption, leading to the time use rebound effect (TRE). Research suggests that the TRE in tourism can be high, especially in relation to tourist travel, but its understanding is limited. This study aims to provide empirical evidence of the TRE by categorizing tourist groups that are most prone to its occurrence. An exploratory sequential mixed methods approach is employed. Key factors that influence the potential TRE occurrence include socio-demographic characteristics, holiday preferences, time/money availability, time perception/attitudes, and time use patterns on holiday. The “Busy explorer” cluster of tourists is most likely to show TREs. Implications and suggestions for future research are outlined. © The Author(s) 2021.},

This study argues that sectoral carbon footprints vary, and so does the impact of technical innovation (Transportation (MTT), production and processing (MTPP), and Energy generation (MTEG)) in mitigation efforts. Therefore, the study examines their influence along with taxes in OECD economies from 1990 to 2020. The preliminary assessment uses second-generation techniques, while the long-run relationship among variables is examined using Error-correction-based models because of cross-sectional interdependencies. The findings affirm the existence of long-term linkages between variables. Transport-related innovation (MTT) reduces demand-based (DBE) and GHG emissions by elasticities of 0.115 and 0.126, respectively. Similarly, MTEG and MTPP technologies reduce production-based emission (PBE) by 0.174% and 0.137%, respectively, and GHG by 0.301% and 0.140%.

	abstract = {One of the profound impacts of digitalization on supply chains is manifested through e-commerce. The latter has significantly grown during the last two decades, with further amplifications during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created operational and policy making challenges for firms when deciding about how best to manage the resulting growth in e-commerce. While the impact of e-commerce on supply chains has been widely recognized in the literature, there was no effort to systematically review the literature, conceptualize some of the challenges and propose future research directions. This paper fills this gap by reviewing 153 publications from 1999 to 2019. We classify the reviewed literature based on which supply chain drivers were investigated, as well as, the employed research methodology. In addition, we conduct network and content analysis to uncover the main research themes and potential research directions namely, developing analytical centred; modelling based ecosystem for environment; leveraging data mining to enhance sustainability; balance between growth and sustainability; consumer demand and uncertainty; coordination in e-commerce logistics; last mile alternatives and cost management of innovative technique implementations. Furthermore, based on our literature review, we propose a conceptual framework where we interlink supply chain stages with a firm's business strategy, digital transformation strategy and performance. © 2022},

This treatise is one of the most important sources for the study of the various meditative currents that were transmitted to Tibet from India and China during the early dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet. Written from the vantage point of the Great Completeness (rDzogs-chen, pron. Dzogchen) and its vehicle of effortless spontaneity, it discusses, in the manner of a doxography, both sutra-based-including Chan-and tantric approaches to meditation. The unabridged, annotated English translation of the Tibetan treatise is preceded by a general introduction situating the author-a pivotal figure in what would become the rNying-ma (pron. Nyingma) school of Tibetan Buddhism-and discussing the historical and doctrinal context of his work. The detailed annotations to the translation provide elucidating comments as well as crucial references for the numerous texts quoted by the Tibetan author.

	abstract = {Lipases are used for enzymatic production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME/ biodiesel), an alternative fuel. However, lipases are intolerant to methanol, which is one of the substrates in the transesterification reaction to produce biodiesel. Methanol denatures lipases and thereby significantly reduces FAME yield. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate methanol induced denaturation of Candida rugosa lipase and the effects of adding glycine betaine (GB), (an osmolyte), to the reaction medium, to keep lipase catalytically active in the presence of methanol. Simulation studies indicate a significant reduction in lipase denaturation, in the presence of 3 M and above concentrations of GB. The simulation results were experimentally validated by assessing FAME yield in the presence and absence of GB. Higher yields of FAME in the presence of GB confirm catalytically active lipase, indicating a stable enzyme and stabilizing action of GB on lipase in the presence of methanol. This study can therefore be regarded as a proof-of-concept to ascertain the stabilizing effect of glycine betaine, on lipase, in the presence of methanol. Furthermore, the fuel properties of the FAME synthesized were assessed by ASTM methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Plastics have conveyed great benefits to humanity and made possible some of the most significant advances of modern civilization in fields as diverse as medicine, electronics, aerospace, construction, food packaging, and sports. It is now clear, however, that plastics are also responsible for significant harms to human health, the economy, and the earth's environment. These harms occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, from extraction of the coal, oil, and gas that are its main feedstocks through to ultimate disposal into the environment. The extent of these harms not been systematically assessed, their magnitude not fully quantified, and their economic costs not comprehensively counted. Goals: The goals of this Minderoo-Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health are to comprehensively examine plastics' impacts across their life cycle on: (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations-the poor, minorities, and the world's children. On the basis of this examination, the Commission offers science-based recommendations designed to support development of a Global Plastics Treaty, protect human health, and save lives. Report structure: This Commission report contains seven Sections. Following an Introduction, Section 2 presents a narrative review of the processes involved in plastic production, use, and disposal and notes the hazards to human health and the environment associated with each of these stages. Section 3 describes plastics' impacts on the ocean and notes the potential for plastic in the ocean to enter the marine food web and result in human exposure. Section 4 details plastics' impacts on human health. Section 5 presents a first-order estimate of plastics' health-related economic costs. Section 6 examines the intersection between plastic, social inequity, and environmental injustice. Section 7 presents the Commission's findings and recommendations. Plastics: Plastics are complex, highly heterogeneous, synthetic chemical materials. Over 98% of plastics are produced from fossil carbon- coal, oil and gas. Plastics are comprised of a carbon-based polymer backbone and thousands of additional chemicals that are incorporated into polymers to convey specific properties such as color, flexibility, stability, water repellence, flame retardation, and ultraviolet resistance. Many of these added chemicals are highly toxic. They include carcinogens, neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), brominated flame retardants, and organophosphate flame retardants. They are integral components of plastic and are responsible for many of plastics' harms to human health and the environment.Global plastic production has increased almost exponentially since World War II, and in this time more than 8,300 megatons (Mt) of plastic have been manufactured. Annual production volume has grown from under 2 Mt in 1950 to 460 Mt in 2019, a 230-fold increase, and is on track to triple by 2060. More than half of all plastic ever made has been produced since 2002. Single-use plastics account for 35-40% of current plastic production and represent the most rapidly growing segment of plastic manufacture. Explosive recent growth in plastics production reflects a deliberate pivot by the integrated multinational fossil-carbon corporations that produce coal, oil and gas and that also manufacture plastics. These corporations are reducing their production of fossil fuels and increasing plastics manufacture. The two principal factors responsible for this pivot are decreasing global demand for carbon-based fuels due to increases in 'green' energy, and massive expansion of oil and gas production due to fracking. Plastic manufacture is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to climate change. At present, plastic production is responsible for an estimated 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the contribution of Brazil. This fraction is projected to increase to 4.5% by 2060 if current trends continue unchecked. Plastic life cycle: The plastic life cycle has three phases: production, use, and disposal. In production, carbon feedstocks-coal, gas, and oil-are transformed through energy-intensive, catalytic processes into a vast array of products. Plastic use occurs in every aspect of modern life and results in widespread human exposure to the chemicals contained in plastic. Single-use plastics constitute the largest portion of current use, followed by synthetic fibers and construction. Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950. Strategies for disposal of plastic waste include controlled and uncontrolled landfilling, open burning, thermal conversion, and export. Vast quantities of plastic waste are exported each year from high-income to low-income countries, where it accumulates in landfills, pollutes air and water, degrades vital ecosystems, befouls beaches and estuaries, and harms human health-environmental injustice on a global scale. Plastic-laden e-waste is particularly problematic. Environmental findings: Plastics and plastic-associated chemicals are responsible for widespread pollution. They contaminate aquatic (marine and freshwater), terrestrial, and atmospheric environments globally. The ocean is the ultimate destination for much plastic, and plastics are found throughout the ocean, including coastal regions, the sea surface, the deep sea, and polar sea ice. Many plastics appear to resist breakdown in the ocean and could persist in the global environment for decades. Macro- and micro-plastic particles have been identified in hundreds of marine species in all major taxa, including species consumed by humans. Trophic transfer of microplastic particles and the chemicals within them has been demonstrated. Although microplastic particles themselves (>10 µm) appear not to undergo biomagnification, hydrophobic plastic-associated chemicals bioaccumulate in marine animals and biomagnify in marine food webs. The amounts and fates of smaller microplastic and nanoplastic particles (MNPs <10 µm) in aquatic environments are poorly understood, but the potential for harm is worrying given their mobility in biological systems. Adverse environmental impacts of plastic pollution occur at multiple levels from molecular and biochemical to population and ecosystem. MNP contamination of seafood results in direct, though not well quantified, human exposure to plastics and plastic-associated chemicals. Marine plastic pollution endangers the ocean ecosystems upon which all humanity depends for food, oxygen, livelihood, and well-being. Human health findings: Coal miners, oil workers and gas field workers who extract fossil carbon feedstocks for plastic production suffer increased mortality from traumatic injury, coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Plastic production workers are at increased risk of leukemia, lymphoma, hepatic angiosarcoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, neurotoxic injury, and decreased fertility. Workers producing plastic textiles die of bladder cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and interstitial lung disease at increased rates. Plastic recycling workers have increased rates of cardiovascular disease, toxic metal poisoning, neuropathy, and lung cancer. Residents of "fenceline" communities adjacent to plastic production and waste disposal sites experience increased risks of premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, childhood leukemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. During use and also in disposal, plastics release toxic chemicals including additives and residual monomers into the environment and into people. National biomonitoring surveys in the USA document population-wide exposures to these chemicals. Plastic additives disrupt endocrine function and increase risk for premature births, neurodevelopmental disorders, male reproductive birth defects, infertility, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and cancers. Chemical-laden MNPs formed through the environmental degradation of plastic waste can enter living organisms, including humans. Emerging, albeit still incomplete evidence indicates that MNPs may cause toxicity due to their physical and toxicological effects as well as by acting as vectors that transport toxic chemicals and bacterial pathogens into tissues and cells.Infants in the womb and young children are two populations at particularly high risk of plastic-related health effects. Because of the exquisite sensitivity of early development to hazardous chemicals and children's unique patterns of exposure, plastic-associated exposures are linked to increased risks of prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight, birth defects of the reproductive organs, neurodevelopmental impairment, impaired lung growth, and childhood cancer. Early-life exposures to plastic-associated chemicals also increase the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases later in life. Economic findings: Plastic's harms to human health result in significant economic costs. We estimate that in 2015 the health-related costs of plastic production exceeded $250 billion (2015 Int$) globally, and that in the USA alone the health costs of disease and disability caused by the plastic-associated chemicals PBDE, BPA and DEHP exceeded $920 billion (2015 Int$). Plastic production results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to 1.96 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2e) annually. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) social cost of carbon metric, we estimate the annual costs of these GHG emissions to be $341 billion (2015 Int$).These costs, large as they are, almost certainly underestimate the full economic losses resulting from plastics' negative impacts on human health and the global environment. All of plastics' economic costs-and also its social costs-are externalized by the petrochemical and plastic manufacturing industry and are borne by citizens, taxpayers, and governments in countries around the world without compensation. Social justice findings: The adverse effects of plastics and plastic pollution on human health, the economy and the environment are not evenly distributed. They disproportionately affect poor, disempowered, and marginalized populations such as workers, racial and ethnic minorities, "fenceline" communities, Indigenous groups, women, and children, all of whom had little to do with creating the current plastics crisis and lack the political influence or the resources to address it. Plastics' harmful impacts across its life cycle are most keenly felt in the Global South, in small island states, and in disenfranchised areas in the Global North. Social and environmental justice (SEJ) principles require reversal of these inequitable burdens to ensure that no group bears a disproportionate share of plastics' negative impacts and that those who benefit economically from plastic bear their fair share of its currently externalized costs. Conclusions: It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices.The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in global plastic production. Plastics' harms are further magnified by low rates of recovery and recycling and by the long persistence of plastic waste in the environment. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The transport sector is facing challenging transformations in order to reach the climate goals according to the European Green Deal. This review aims to compile a comprehensive set of available energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission data to estimate a) road transportation and site-related GHG emissions from logistics companies and b) impacts of mitigation measures discussed in literature. Out of an initial set of 1,050 hits, about 77 publications were identified that provide quantitative values for energy consumption or GHG emissions. The largest part of literature on energy demand and emissions in logistics deals with transport, with 62 out of 77 publications, which accounts for the majority of the energy demand in the logistics sector. The majority of published data is based on individual case analyses and modeling studies, reflecting the heterogeneity of the industry. As there is no standardized method for collecting GHG emissions for the logistics sector, the system boundaries and quantitative values of the published data vary considerably, making comparisons and evaluations difficult. The most common system boundary is “freight transport within a given area”, followed by “logistics site”, “vehicle routing”, “supply chain” and “corporate footprint”. Reported energy and GHG reduction potentials focus on the optimization of building services efficiency, intralogistics processes and transport-related processes (route planning, driving behavior, vehicle efficiency and load factor). The greatest potential for reducing GHG emissions in the logistics sector lies in replacing fossil fuels for trucks with green fuels or electrification, combined with restructuring urban delivery networks. Publications of actual consumption or transport-specific metrics are rare in the literature. The quantitative values reported can only be interpreted correctly if the context in which they occur is specified in terms of a logistics reference value; this is why the effects of the mitigation measures applied also vary in the literature. The further development of standardization in the field of emissions recording by transport companies and the consensus on a uniform reference value are therefore key drivers for the quantification and reduction of GHG emissions in the logistics sector. © The Author(s) 2023.},

These changes are creating severe friction between the old and new paradigms. This book provides new perspectives through the process of ideological disassociation and concepts of human mobility code. The basic premise of the book, human mobility is an essential component of our creativity that comes from our unconscious desire to become a part of a community. Several new concepts in the book starts with the hallmark of new discovery of human mobility code and its implications of urban mobility boundary systems to stay within safe planetary zone. A new discovery of human mobility code from comprehensive research finding prove that each individual develops a unique mobility footprint and become our mobility identity. Beyond individual hallmarks, human develops collective mobility codes through interaction with the third space on which entire mobility systems lie and are created by the fundamentals of city planning and the design process. Readers are introduced to an innovative mobility planning process and reinvention of multimodal mobility approaches based on new mobility code while formulating new concepts, practical solutions and implementation techniques, tools, policies, and processes to reinforce low-carbon mobility options while addressing social equity, environmental, and health benefits. Finally, the book arms us with knowledge to prevent the disaster of full technological enlightenment against our natural human mobility code. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Urban logistics is an important research topic in human and economic geography; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging technology that has huge potential in the field of logistics with the release of control restrictions on low-altitude airspace. The scientific identification of the spatial pattern and impact factors of UAV logistics networks is greatly significant in regards to UAV logistics planning and scheduling. This study considered the urban logistics network of Hangzhou in 2020 as the research topic and used kernel density estimation, a geodetector, and geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis technology to systematically analyze the spatial patterns and influencing factors at the city and district scales. The study found that a significant spatial pattern was revealed in the UAV logistics network in Hangzhou, and the logistics nodes showed an obvious “core-edge” structure. The urban population, market scale and logistics infrastructure jointly shaped the structure and function of the UAV logistics network, and logistics nodes had a strong coupling relationship with the urban spatial structure. Through interaction detectors, the technical route of urban UAV logistics network construction was analyzed and summarized, and results can provide a scientific basis and case reference for other cities to build and plan UAV logistics networks. © 2022 by the authors.},

That is, the tools deployed to classify and measure the natural world interact with the things they were designed to observe. The idea of performativity also captures the way these interactions shape or distort the governance activities that metrics are used to inform. The performativity of metrics reveals how mundane practices of measurement and auditing are inscribed with substantial power. This has proven particularly true for the global warming metrics, like GWP100, that are central to the management of anthropogenic climate change. Greenhouse gases are materially heterogenous, and the metrics used to commensurate their various warming impacts influence the distribution of both culpability and capital in climate policy and markets. The publication of a new warming metric, GWP* (or GWP Star), has generated a modest scientific controversy, as a diverse cast of stakeholders recognize this performativity seek to influence the metrological regime under which they live. We analyse this controversy, particularly as it unfolded in the fractious discourse around sustainable food and farming, to develop the concept of reflexive performativity: where actors are anticipatory and strategic in their engagement with the metrics that are used to govern their lives. We situate this idea in relation to, and in tentative evidential support of, the concept of reflexive modernization. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Humans and human wellbeing depend on the natural resources provided by Planet Earth, and they depend on the solidarity between human beings. That is, on the social resources provided by society. Both types of resources are available to everyone: they are public goods. The book approaches the topic from various angles, including the often-neglected dimension of measuring. It offers a holistic conception that covers the macro- and the micro-economic, the political and the developmental aspects. It shows which range of action is available at different levels of decision-making and which outcomes these may provide. And it emphasizes that a philosophical base is needed for understanding and managing the topic, and that wellbeing can only be improved and the common good can only be maintained if the public and the private sectors cooperate. With the advent of the United Nations' sustainable development goals, this cooperation has received momentum in all its facets and for all levels - from the local to the global. The book is aimed both at scholars and students as well as practitioners in businesses and in public service. In academia, it may serve as a companion to textbooks on, e.g., public finance, sustainable development, social affairs, and public-private partnerships, both in undergraduate and graduate levels. For professionals in businesses and in public service, the book offers an insight into the topic that does not recur to an academic language. There is always a need for books that appeal both to readers who are managers as well as to scholars who wish to glance beyond their adopted profession. • Integrates the macro- and the micro-economic perspectives • An easy reading for non-academics that still provides state-of-the art scholarly knowledge • A timely publication that shows how crisis situations can be overcome by collective efforts. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Young people around the world are creating their own spaces, strategies, and politics for climate action. In this article we explore the everyday informal politics of climate activism by youth from Aotearoa New Zealand's largest city (Auckland). We examine how young people, frustrated by the lack of global and domestic political inertia, are operationalizing their concerns about climate change into actions in their daily lives directed at mitigating their greenhouse gas emissions. Through a relational qualitative approach, we document the contradictory standing of youth, specifically as agentic actors and environmental citizens, who are aware of and seeking climate action through multiple modes of action including protesting, eco-consuming, influencing others, and eco-caring work. Our youth participants reported how their participation in various forms of climate activism helped to reduce their eco-anxiety and made them more hopeful about their collective abilities to address climate change. Our participants highlighted a hopeful view that their small-scale individual actions will collectively add up to large-scale changes at a systemic level. However, they were highly aware of and critical of state and corporate actors attempts to shift responsibility for taking actions to mitigate climate change onto individuals. Rather than situating themselves solely as eco-consumers engaging in eco-friendly purchasing practices, our youth participants narrated their sometimes contradictory climate actions (protesting, buy-cotting or boycotting, changing how they used goods, and services) as acts of resistance against the socio-economic status quo (high-carbon, neoliberal, and capitalist) that could act as trigger points for wider change. In this article we identify the various methods by which young people are participating in daily climate politics and demonstrating their agency, which are evident in their diverse pro-environmental-oriented and climate mitigation actions; all of which is evidence of how youth are seeking to be good climate citizens. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Despite significant progress in reducing the amount of oil in the sea from consumption, exploration, transportation, and production, risks remain. This report, the fourth in a series, documents the current state-of-knowledge on inputs, fates and effects of oil in the sea, reflecting almost 20 additional years of research, including long-term effects from spills such as the Exxon Valdez and a decade-long boom in oil spill science research following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The report finds that land-based sources of oil are the biggest input of oil to the sea, far outweighing other sources, and it also notes that the effects of chronic inputs on the marine environment, such as land-based runoff, are very different than that from an acute input, such as a spill. Steps to prevent chronic land-based oil inputs include reducing gasoline vehicle usage, improving fuel efficiency, increasing usage of electric vehicles, replacing older vehicles. The report identifies research gaps and provides specific recommendations aimed at preventing future accidental spills and ensuring oil spill responders are equipped with the best response tools and information to limit oil's impact on the marine environment. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

I first discuss factors that affect the likelihood that individuals engage in a wide range of climate actions. Next, I review the processes through which values affect climate actions and reflect on how to motivate climate actions among people who do not strongly care about nature, the environment, and climate change. Then I explain that even people who may be motivated to engage in climate actions may not do so when they face major barriers to act. This implies that to promote wide-scale climate actions, broader system changes are needed. I discuss relevant factors that affect public support for system changes that facilitate and enable climate action. Finally, I summarize key lessons learned and identify important questions for future research. Copyright © 2023 by the author(s).},

The relevance of the ocean for humanity's future is undisputed. However, the ocean’s great potential to drive economic growth and equitable job creation, sustain healthy ecosystems, and mitigate climate change is not yet fully recognised. Lack of awareness of this potential as well as management and governance challenges pose impediments. Until these impediments are removed, ocean ecosystems will continue to be degraded and opportunities for people lost. A transition and a clear path to a thriving and vibrant relationship between humans and the ocean are urgently needed. This open access collection of papers and reports identifies a path that is inspired by science, energised by engaged people, and emboldened by visionary leaders. These assessments of knowledge are commissioned by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel), which was established in September 2018 as a unique initiative led by heads of state and government from around the world, to showcase the latest leading-edge science, knowledge and state-of-the-art thinking on key ocean issues. Altogether, The Blue Compendium offers innovative ocean solutions in technology, policy, governance, and finance realms, that could help accelerate a transition to a more sustainable and prosperous relationship with the ocean. The comprehensive assessments have already informed policy making at the highest levels of government and motivated an impressive array of responsive and ambitious action across a growing network of leaders in business, finance and civil society. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

The prospect of implementing an Emissions Trading System (ETS) for shipping has come to prominence as a proposed mechanism for speeding up the decarbonisation of the industry, with the EU taking proactive action to include shipping within the EU ETS by 2023. This paper analyses and provides a qualitative review of the historical development of the discussions and actions taken at both global level (by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)) and at regional level within the EU. A SWOT analysis of the potential implementation of an ETS for shipping is then presented. The paper concludes that an ETS for shipping can incentivise greater investment in, and deployment of, green technologies that will have the effect of reducing the carbon footprint of the shipping industry. However, the speed and significance of this effect will depend upon the specific shipping market segment and the relative stage in shipping market cycles over time. It is further concluded that despite the imminent unilateral introduction of shipping into the EU ETS, it is important that the IMO continues its work to develop a global ETS that promotes a ‘level playing field’ for competition within the sector and eliminates the risk of carbon leakage. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: The impact of applying circular strategies to products is often measured through life cycle assessment (LCA). While LCA estimates and compares the impacts of circular products, its ability to integrate consumer behaviour is currently limited. The integration of consumer behavioural insights is especially relevant in the packaging sector, where consumer actions at the end-of-life are crucial for the success of circular strategies. This study explores integrating behavioural insights from consumer behaviour sciences (including psychology, sociology and socio-technical approaches) into LCA for a better assessment and design of circular packaging. Methods: Through a scoping review, scientific literature was mapped to (1) investigate the current integration of consumer behaviour aspects within packaging LCAs and (2) explore the behavioural determinants influencing the recycling and reusing of circular packaging. By building on the insights from these reviews, this study provides recommendations on how to integrate behavioural insights with LCA to assess the impact of circular packaging systems. Results and discussion: The results indicate that LCA studies for packaging are generally based on assumptions on consumer behaviour, reducing their utility for circular decision-making. The main methods currently used to integrate behaviour variability are scenario and sensitivity analysis, with some studies using consumer profiles and behaviour research to support LCA modelling. Socio-technical approaches, e.g. agent-based modelling or system dynamics, have not been applied yet to integrate a behavioural perspective into the LCA of circular packaging, while this may be a promising avenue. The behaviour science literature covered several predictors found to be important to understand packaging reuse and recycling behaviour. Our review shows that attitudinal and value dimensions have consistently been found to influence both packaging reuse and recycling behaviour, while the latter is also strongly driven by control factors. While LCA modellers can obtain behavioural insights from the behavioural literature, the step of transforming these insights into quantifiable behaviour patterns still needs to be taken. Such endeavours can help to translate individual behaviour predictors into behavioural patterns regarding packaging reuse and recycling. Conclusions: Consumer behaviour is currently not widely considered in the LCA of circular packaging. Insights from consumer behaviour sciences can contribute to LCA studies in two main ways: defining consumer profiles and modelling socio-technical parameters. Consumer profiles could be drawn from the psychological behaviour literature, while socio-technical approaches can provide models of system behaviour where the interaction of different system actors and items is quantitatively modelled and coupled with LCA models. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Recent proposals in the US and elsewhere aim to tackle climate change and socioeconomic inequalities together through a Green New Deal (GND). GND proposals have been criticized by high-profile advocates of carbon-centric climate policies—advocates who do not perceive socioeconomic inequalities to be significant drivers of climate change and who argue that GNDs’ wider agenda will undermine decarbonization efforts. Here, we show that socioeconomic inequalities drive emissions-intensive consumption and production, facilitate the obstruction of climate policies by wealthy elites, undermine public support for climate policy, and weaken the social foundations of collective action. This suggests that integrating certain carbon-centric policies into a wider program of social, economic, and democratic reforms would achieve decarbonization more effectively than carbon-centric policies alone. We show that common policy components of GNDs do indeed tackle the causal mechanisms by which inequalities fuel climate change, and we argue that GNDs enable more effective political strategies than carbon-centric policies. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Environmental pollution comes from several sectors of activities. It is almost conceivable that the education sector subsidies to the disruption of the environmental quality. The study employs panel cointegration techniques and method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) to inspect the influence of income, education (scholarly enrollment and expenditure), and foreign direct investment on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for a panel of 46 Belt and Road initiative (BRI) countries spanning the period 1996–2016. The estimation shows that the hypothesis of environmental Kuznets is established for both the models. Using fully modified ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed effects OLS and dynamic OLS, long-run elasticities show that real income increases the emissions. At the same time, foreign direct investment and education contribute toward decreasing the emissions in the long run. Using the approach of MMQR, the estimated coefficients confirm that only economic growth positively affects pollution. However, education and foreign direct investment negatively influence CO2 emissions with different quantile levels. As policy recommendations, governments of the BRI region should improve the educational services by installing new technologies, equipment, and supplies, which leads to mitigation of the emission levels.

	abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) growth can be stalled due to social acceptance. Agrivoltaics can improve social acceptance by enabling dual use of land. The most popular type of agrivoltaics in North America is grazing sheep under conventional PV farms. The environmental benefits of this integrated agrivoltaic system are unknown, so this ISO-compliant life cycle assessment study investigates the environmental performance of sheep-based agrivoltaic systems. This study investigated agrivoltaics to produce a combined output of electricity and agricultural goods, in comparison to conventional methods (various electric grid generation mixes in the U.S. and plane pastures) for producing that same quantify of service in both categories. Agrivoltaics is twice as land use efficient as providing sheep and PV services separately. In addition, the global warming potential of agrivoltaics was found to be 3.9% better than conventional PV and sheep grazing separately, and represents two orders of magnitude improvement (280%-894%) over conventional grids in the U.S. and sheep production. Only considering emission reductions from shifting sheep to PV farms for grazing, the U.S. could conserve 5.73E8 kg CO2 eq per year from sheep raising, which is equivalent to removing 117,000 average automobiles from the road. To house the current national 5.2 million domestic sheep in agrivoltaic systems, the U.S. has the potential to expand utility scale PV by a factor of four. The results of this study provide further evidence that agrivoltaic systems are superior to conventional ground-mounted PV systems because they have dual purposes and reduce the environmental impacts associated with producing food and electricity. It is clear that encouraging sheep grazing on all appropriate conventional PV systems is warranted. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Sand and gravel aggregate (SGA) transportation accounts for over 30% of the freight volume in China, which is greater than that of any other cargo; low-carbon development can effectively promote the decarbonization of freight transportation. This study presents a four-step evaluation method to assess CO2 emission reductions in freight transportation; the proposed method helps determine the relationship between the policy, CO2 emission reductions, demand, and mode market share. Using Beijing as a case study, this paper estimates the potential of reducing CO2 emissions from SGA transportation under various scenarios. The scenarios are set based on the avoid, shift, and improve strategies; the results of the Beijing case indicate that the CO2 emission for SGA transportation is 920.86 kt, which is approximately 1% of the total CO2 emissions in Beijing. The maximum reductions in CO2 emissions that can be achieved using the avoid, shift, and improve strategies are 0.92 kt (0.1% of total), 560.52 kt (60.9% of total), and 78.59 kt (8.5% of total), respectively. The shift strategy is confirmed to be the most realistic and cost-effective approach for reducing CO2 emissions from SGA transportation. In addition, the implementation of subsidy policies is discussed. Marginal abatement costs under the subsidy scenarios are higher than 224 CNY/t, which is higher than the price in the Chinese carbon trading market. © 2023},

This has led to the development of green port initiatives in the field of maritime transport and logistics, which aim to promote sustainable practices and reduce the environmental footprint of ports and their operations. One of the key strategies for achieving this goal is the use of renewable energy technologies (RETs). This paper summarizes the potentials, challenges, and economic analysis of RETs applications in green ports, emphasizing those that require aquatic environments for operation, including floating photovoltaic systems, offshore wind turbines, and ocean energy. The paper investigates the concept of green ports and explores the feasibility of integrating RETs into these facilities. Also, the potential of the various RETs is presented in terms of technical and economic aspects and installed capacity. Additionally, due to high flexibility in electrical systems and compatibility with maritime transportation, the use of fuel cells in green ports has been discussed as a feasible solution for supplying power to ports (either as the primary or backup source). The findings of this study show that RETs can significantly contribute to achieving sustainable goals in the maritime industry and pave the way for the creation of more efficient and environmentally friendly ports. © 2023 The Authors.

We apply the model to a real-world case study in Berlin. We produce a well-fitted (R-squared greater than 94%) simulation environment in which the three interventions lead to reductions in delivery costs (up to 23%), delivery time (up to 40%) and emission levels (up to 53%). We contribute to the literature by proposing a data-driven, decision-making tools which allows for multi-objective (local) optimization.

	abstract = {The modernization of agriculture has transformed natural agrarian systems into other new conventional ones, making it possible to exponentially increase agricultural production. This leads to the destruction of ecological functions, and services, and has negative impacts on human health. This critical situation has given rise to a new model of agriculture called agroecology, which has emerged as a systemic approach that can understand the practices of traditional agricultural systems, as a scientific discipline that defines, classifies, and studies agrosystems from an ecological and socio-economic point of view. This paper explores the major problems of agriculture, including climate change, monoculture, and chemical fertilization at the local, regional and global scale. Equally, we defined the different concepts that bring together the agroecological approach. We based on agroecology as a scientific discipline, as a practice by defining the different agroecological practices and their scale of application, as well as the politico-economic aspect of this concept. Further, we have proposed the agroecological alternatives that can remedy the three problems recorded in the first section, based on several recent studies and research that can examine whether agroecological practices have positive results on monoculture, chemical fertilization, and climate changes. However, more advanced studies, using rigorous research design, such as case controls, longitudinal studies, and surveys in regions where agriculture is their main source of income, such as Morocco, are still needed. These investigations are suggested to fill the gap of data on such areas and fields of research. © 2023 Istituto Agronomico per l'Oltremare di Firenze. All rights reserved.},

Moreover, the study describes the positive shock of foreign direct investment (FDI) as a significant and positive relationship with environmental degradation, while the negative shock of FDI shows a negative and significant relationship with the environment. Furthermore, the study scrutinizes the positive shock of green finance as a significant and negative relationship with environmental degradation; the negative shocks also show a negative relationship with environmental degradation in Pakistan. In addition, the consequences of the study suggest that the government should implement taxes on foreign investment and that investors should use renewable energy to produce goods. Furthermore, the results suggest that the government should utilize fiscal policy and fiscal funds to enhance carbon-free projects. Moreover, green securities should be used for green technologies. However, Pakistan can control its carbon emissions and achieve the target of a sustainable environment. Therefore, Pakistan’s government should stabilize its financial markets and introduce carbon-free projects. Furthermore, the main quantitative achievement according to the outcomes suggests that policymakers make policies in which they suggest to the government to control foreign investment that causes carbon emissions because of trade openness and also invest the funds in renewable energy, which helps to control the carbon emissions.

	abstract = {This paper delves into the importance of understanding the psychological and cognitive factors that play a vital role in individuals' decision-making and behaviour when it comes to transport. It recognises that while quantitative-based utilities such as cost and performance are important considerations, they are not the only determinants of behaviour. The paper aims to develop a conceptual perspective of psychological and moral values, societal experiences, and service perception and discuss their implications for individuals’ behaviour in transport contexts. To achieve this, the paper draws on theories and concepts from psychology literature, specifically subjective norms and affective attributes. These are used to explore the contextual dimensions of travellers' behaviour and identify the key factors that influence their behaviour and decisions. Thus, two main contributions of the paper are 1) developing a conceptual model that can be used to analyse the decisions of transport users and predict their behaviour 2) reviewing the implications of these factors in the transport context. In particular, the importance of socio-ethical factors in individuals' behaviour toward using transport services and their possible implications in long-term transport planning is discussed. © 2023},

Calculating emissions associated with individual countries is complicated, with data that is publicly available and free to access often being difficult to obtain. In this paper, a case study is presented where commercially sensitive fuel uplift is used to calculate New Zealand specific emissions factors of 0.81 kg CO2 per tonne km (CO2 per t-km) for short-haul and 0.79 kg CO2 per t-km for long-haul international aviation. This was used to estimate international aviation CO2 emissions associated with New Zealand in 2017 to be 8.4 Mt CO2 in total (2 significant figures, rounded down), with international visitor travel to and from New Zealand accounting for 4.3 Mt CO2, New Zealand residents' international travel for 2.6 Mt CO2, exports for 0.72 Mt CO2, and imports for 0.89 Mt CO2 (all 2 significant figures, rounded up). Results show the fleet of aeroplanes which serviced New Zealand between 2007 and 2017 has become, on average, less efficient due to changes in operational factors such as seating density. © 2022 The Author(s).

Beyond Straw Men moves beyond "hot take" or straw man fallacies by illustrating how affective counterpublics mobilized around plastics reveal broader stories about environmental justice and social change. Inspired by on- and offline organizing in the Global South and the Global South of the North, Phaedra C. Pezzullo engages public controversies and policies through analysis of hashtag activism, campaign materials, and podcast interviews with headline-making advocates in Bangladesh, Kenya, the United States, and Vietnam. She argues that plastics have become an articulator of crisis and an entry point into the contested environmental politics of carbon-heavy masculinity, carceral policies, planetary fatalism, eco-ableism, greenwashing, marine life endangerment, pollution colonialism, and waste imperialism. Attuned to plastic attachments, Beyond Straw Men illustrates how everyday people resist unsustainable patterns of the plastics-industrial complex through imperfect but impactful networked cultures of care. © 2023 by Phaedra C.

Chapters highlight the notion that unless a knowledge-based value creation and distribution paradigm is globally adopted, the possibilities for integration between a sustainable biosphere and a viable economy are small. This Modern Guide provides an overview of where we are regarding the knowledge economy and society, how its current form took shape and how our understanding has evolved, from the grounds of the philosophy of knowledge, to include the current branches of the sciences of knowledge. Carrillo further examines the challenges of the Anthropocene and how modern knowledge systems might need to change radically to meet them. The Modern Guide then moves to focus on the integration of epistemic, theoretical, technical and political developments in several fields of knowledge-related aspects of economy and society to offer a more integrated view. Multidisciplinary and thorough, this will be an interesting read for scholars of knowledge, society and the environment, as well as students looking at ways to re-evaluate knowledge more broadly. Policymakers and governmental analysts will also benefit from the discussing of the unviability of our current economic culture and the potential options for the future. © Francisco Javier Carrillo 2022.

The huge negative impact that the disposal of so-called “single-use plastics” has on the environment is propelling the market to search for new solutions, and requires initiatives to drive faster responses from the scientific community, the industry, and governmental bodies for the adoption and implementation of new materials. Bioplastics are an alternative group of materials that are partly or entirely produced from renewable sources. Some bioplastics are biodegradable or even compostable under the right conditions. This review presents the different properties of these materials, mechanisms of biodegradation, and their environmental impact, but also presents a holistic overview of the most important bioplastics available in the market and their potential application for food packaging, consumer perception of the bioplastics, regulatory aspects, and future challenges. © 2022 by the authors.},

However, carbon-neutral operation of industrial port areas (IPA) is challenging and requires the decarbonization of industrial processes and heavy transport systems. This study proposes a comprehensive review of decarbonization strategies for IPA, with a particular focus on the role that green hydrogen could play when used as renewable energy carrier. Much information on existing and future technologies was also derived from the analysis of 74 projects (existing and planned) in 36 IPAs, 80 % of which are in Europe, concerning hydrogen-based decarbonization strategies. The overall review shows that engine operation of ships at berth are responsible of more than 70 % of emissions in ports. Therefore, onshore power supply (OPS) seems to be one of the main strategies to reduce port pollution. Nevertheless, OPS powered by hydrogen is not today easily achievable. By overcoming the current cost-related and regulation barriers, hydrogen can also be used for the import/export of green energy and the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors. The technical and economic data regarding hydrogen-based technologies and strategies highlighted in this paper are useful for further research in the field of definition and development of decarbonization strategies in the IPA. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study offers a new perspective on the drivers of environmental sustainability for sector level (manufacturing, mining, agriculture, business, trade, and transport) analysis. In this case, country-level sectoral dynamic index for technology adoption and emission intensity were constructed to study the environmental efficiency effect of technology adoption and technology diffusion across tradable and non-tradable sectors by using empirical illustration for 49 developing and emerging countries during 1990–2018 period. By correcting for potential bias arising from endogeneity and cross-border spillover effects via cross-section dependence, results reveal long-term effects of technological changes. Importantly, it is shown that the environmental efficiency effect of technology adoption holds in technology-intensive sectors (i.e manufacturing, mining, agriculture) only at lower capitalization levels, thus establishing a U-shaped nexus of technology adoption and carbon emission. Additionally, it is found that trade networks reduce emission intensities by improving technology diffusion across all the tradable sectors and in transport sector. Moreover, trade alone mitigates carbon intensity across all the sectors while income per capita spur carbon intensity in the tradable sectors. From policy insight, the study identifies the need for stricter policy directives to scale up energy and clean technologies adoption in all sector activities. © 2023 The Authors},

It brings to light the full harm to children's physical and mental health being inflicted now by climate change and its root cause-our addiction to fossil fuel. After laying out the scope of the climate crisis, it reviews the health impacts of air pollution from fossil fuel combustion and the effects of higher temperatures, more severe storms, floods, forest fires, drought, infectious disease, and displacement due to climate change It describes how climate change and air pollution can combine to derail early brain development and affect the physical and mental health of children, with lifelong consequences. It reviews new scientific understanding of the unique biologic vulnerability of the developing fetus and child to these threats and the reasons why children in low-income communities and communities of color bear the greatest burden. The book describes the growing power of environmental justice; Indigenous, youth, religious, scientific, and environmental groups; and artists in raising awareness of the crisis and motivating action by governments, business, and other sectors. Following case studies of climate change and air pollution policies that have benefited children's health and the economy, it provides an overview of the solutions now available at the government, community, and individual levels to mitigate climate change and help children and families adapt to climate change. The book ends with a call for integrated climate and social policies to speed the transition to a just zero carbon future. © Oxford University Press 2022.},

	abstract = {The haven paradise hypothesis has been widely supported in the international carbon transfer, but there is still a lack of inter-city evidence. The emergence of the digital economy in recent years has introduced unprecedented opportunities and challenges for carbon emissions reduction and carbon transfer. As the world’s largest carbon emitter and a major player in the digital economy, exploring whether the pollution haven hypothesis exists among cities in China and how the digital economy affects inter-city carbon transfer is crucial for countries to optimize their domestic carbon reduction structures. To this end, this paper employs the 2012 and 2015 Chinese Urban Household Survey data alongside input-output tables based on the life cycle assessment method to quantify the inter-city carbon transfer. In addition, the impact and mechanisms of the digital economy on inter-city carbon transfer are explored using the two-way fixed effects model. The results show that 54% of Chinese cities’ carbon emissions come from outside, with third-tier cities bearing high carbon transfer pressures, indicating the presence of the pollution haven hypothesis. The digital economy exacerbates inter-city carbon transfer by promoting market integration and facilitating industrial transfer, and it mainly promotes the transfer of high-intensity carbon emissions to third-tier cities. Considering carbon emission reduction targets, mandatory environmental regulations have strengthened the effect of the digital economy on carbon transfer. Therefore, the Chinese government needs to properly address carbon transfer by improving the collaborative carbon reduction system, enhancing carbon emission reduction efficiency, and accelerating the equitable progress of the digital economy. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Given the unprecedented level of air pollution in urban areas, green transport systems has been a subject to an important debate in academic and policymaking circles. Despite the considerable outputs of the attendant literature, most of empirical studies to date have relied on conventional econometric models in which structural shocks are not controlled. This study, therefore, aims to offer a new perceptive of the dynamic connection between renewable energy, environment-related technological innovation, and transport-based CO2 emissions in Turkey during 1990Q1 to 2014Q1 by applying the Structural Vector Autoregressive approach (SVAR). Furthermore, to explore the co-movements and the lead-lag interrelations among the study variables, the wavelet coherence technique was used. The wavelet coherence technique circumvents the other traditional causality approaches by detecting the causal interrelation between the underlying series at different frequencies. The findings disclose that environment-related technological innovation has no reliable power to explain the variation in CO2 emissions from the transport sector. Solar energy is found to impact the CO2 emissions positively in the long run, while biofuels hold the same effect in short run. Moreover, per capita GDP and urbanization significantly impact the carbon emissions from the transport system in the long run with a negative sign. The wavelet analysis reveals that renewables and environmental-related technological innovation lead the transport-based CO2 emissions. The fourth and 16th periods are the most dominant frequencies. Accordingly, the study suggests that innovation in environment-related technologies is not enough to mitigate the pollution that stemming from the transport system in Turkey, it should be accompanied by strong and effective environmental measures. These policies might include environmental taxations, carbon pricing and trading schemes, which aim not only to prevent the pollution and over-extraction of resources, but also to promote the public revenues from different activities that related to environmental purposes and other applications such as energy product and vehicle fuels. In addition, it is suggested to strengthening the transportation system through the deployment of renewables and high-tech eco-friendly modes of transportation. Copyright © 2022 Alnour.},

On the other hand, sustainability and high levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with transportation of goods have not yet been considered to be sufficient to help address this gap. This work aims to investigate how flexible delivery time strategies may impact the mileage traveled by vehicles in the LMD. To do that, a discrete event simulation model was developed using the consolidation level and delivery time variables to analyze logistics scenarios. Results revealed that, in certain circumstances, more flexible delivery times and higher levels of shipment consolidation may shorten the total mileage traveled by the vehicles. Moreover, they provide economic and environmental benefits due to reduced fuel consumption and thus GHG emissions with no major impact for consumers. © 2022 The Authors},

However, its implementation faces non-technical challenges, including the need to collaborate with new stakeholders and face societal acceptance issues. Looking at the prominence of the circular economy in current policy developments and the challenges to resource recovery, exploring these issues is urgently needed. In this work, we reviewed a broad range of literature to identify societal values relevant to the recovery of water and other resources from wastewaters, particularly urban and industrial wastewater and desalination brines. We discuss tensions and uncertainties around these values, such as the tension between socio-economic expectations of resource recovery and potential long-term sustainability impacts, as well as uncertainties regarding safety and regulations. For addressing these tensions and uncertainties, we suggest aligning common methods in engineering and the natural sciences with Responsible Innovation approaches, such as Value Sensitive Design and Safe-by-Design. To complement Responsible Innovation, social learning with a Sustainability Transitions or Adaptive Governance perspective is suggested. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon emissions have the potential to trigger changes in climate and ecosystems that would be catastrophic for the well-being of humans and other species. Widespread shifts in production and consumption patterns are urgently needed to address climate change. Although transnational agreements and national policy are necessary for a transition to a fully decarbonized global economy, fluctuating political priorities and lobbying by vested interests have slowed these efforts. Against this backdrop, bottom-up pressure from social movements and shifting social norms may offer a complementary path to a more sustainable economy. Furthermore, norm change may be an important component of decarbonization policies by accelerating or strengthening the impacts of other demand-side measures. Individual actions and policy support are social processes—they are intimately linked to expectations about the actions and beliefs of others. Although prevailing social norms often reinforce the status quo and unsustainable development pathways, social dynamics can also create widespread and rapid shifts in cultural values and practices, including increasing pressure on politicians to enact ambitious policy. We synthesize literature on social-norm influence, measurement, and change from the perspectives of psychology, anthropology, sociology, and economics. We discuss the opportunities and challenges for the use of social-norm and social-tipping interventions to promote climate action. Social-norm interventions aimed at addressing climate change or other social dilemmas are promising but no panacea. They require in-depth contextual knowledge, ethical consideration, and situation-specific tailoring and testing to understand whether they can be effectively implemented at scale. Our review aims to provide practitioners with insights and tools to reflect on the promises and pitfalls of such interventions in diverse contexts. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Although developed countries have been historically responsible for causing climate change, developing countries are more vulnerable to its current and future effects and being asked to commit to levels of climate action that exceed their responsibilities and capabilities. Climate change exacerbates existing social inequities by disproportionately impacting certain groups (including women, racial minorities, and the poor) more than others. Powerful institutions such as the government and the academy have a responsibility to alter this course and advance climate justice but are themselves marred by inequities. Given these disparities, the question of how the burden of climate change mitigation should be justly distributed amongst stakeholders is of paramount importance to international and domestic climate negotiations. Insights from the social identity and group processes literatures explain how experiences of inequity along geographical and sociodemographic dimensions generate identities and groups. As group members, people are sensitive to threats to the ingroup, experience collective emotions on behalf of the group, and differentially apply morality to in- versus outgroups. Members are also incentivized to protect and further their group's interests relative to outgroups. Social psychology offers some promising avenues of research for potential solutions to mitigate the multilevel intergroup conflict posing as a barrier to climate justice. Climate governance recommendations to policymakers and negotiators include incentivizing integrative solutions and fully considering the justice implications of climate policy. Climate scholars are encouraged to pursue interdisciplinary collaborations, improve diversity within the academy and in research samples, and prioritize climate adaptation in developing contexts.

	abstract = {Science is essential to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) mission to protect human health and the environment. EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) provides the scientific bases for regulatory and public health policies that have broad impacts on the nation’s natural resources and quality of human life and that yield economic benefits and incur compliance costs for the regulated community. In addition, ORD develops the agency’s core research capabilities, providing tools and methods that can be applied to address complex environmental challenges. ORD research aids in the development of responses to emerging threats, provides scientific methods for ecological and human health risk assessment, and serves as a national and international resource for the advancement of environmental science. Those activities require the integration of scientific evidence across many disciplines including biology, chemistry, ecology, engineering, toxicology, air quality, water quality, exposure science, social science, and environmental health. Meeting the agency’s research needs is complicated by EPA’s regulatory role in often controversial policy decisions and challenged by ORD’s steadily declining budgets and workforce capacity. As a part of fulfilling its role, ORD conducts innovative and forward-looking research that improves EPA’s capability of addressing emerging, complex environmental problems. It pursues that endeavor while meeting the need for reactive, problem-driven research to support EPA’s implementation of statutory requirements and other decision-making. ORD recognizes that continued accomplishment of EPA’s mission requires research that anticipates the most challenging problems, develops and adapts emerging scientific tools, and identifies and implements innovative solutions. In that light, ORD asked the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to form a committee to identify emerging scientific and technological advances from across a broad range of disciplines, such as environmental monitoring and data science, that ORD should consider in its research planning to support EPA’s mission, provide advice on how ORD might strategically position its research and development enterprise to anticipate and respond to the future research needs of the agency, and consider advances that help EPA better incorporate systems thinking into interdisciplinary approaches. © 2023 by the National Academy of Sciences.},

The global energy crisis, aggravated by rising energy prices, has sparked a thorough analysis of its causes. We demonstrate the significance of categorizing research by influence channels while focusing on their implications for energy policy decisions. We investigate the growing number of studies that use GDP, inflation, central banks’ characteristics, corruption, and uncertainty as critical factors in determining energy policies. Energy prices fluctuate because energy policies shift the supply–demand equilibrium. We categorise the effects and show that GDP, economic policy uncertainty, and, most notably, specific economic conditions and extreme events play a significant role in determining energy prices. We observed that energy consumption, GDP growth, and energy prices have a bidirectional, causal relationship. Still, the literature has not established which causative direction is the most significant. Taxes, interest rates, and corruption also significantly determine energy prices, although the origins of corruption have not been adequately examined. Lastly, uncertainty generally increases energy costs, but this relationship requires additional research in terms of the features of countries, conditions, and, most importantly, the theoretical backgrounds used. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Consumption is evidenced to play an increasing significant role accompanied by economic transition in China. Carbon emissions caused by consumption are becoming an important growth point of carbon emissions. The size of China's middle-income groups is growing and is expected to reach 60 % of the population in 2035. However, the amount of indirect carbon emissions from household consumption (ICEHCs) of middle-income groups and the effects of their drivers have not been quantitatively assessed. In response, this paper adopts input-output tables to calculate urban-rural middle-income groups' ICEHCs from 2012 to 2018, and uses structural decomposition analysis to determine the effects of drivers and sectors. Results are as follows: Urban-rural middle-income groups' ICEHCs in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) are increasing and its differences are significant, and present a spatial pattern of high in the eastern region while low in the western region. S22 (Production and Supply of Electric Power, Steam and Hot Water) becomes the main sector of carbon emissions, which accounts for about 70.00 % of the total middle-income groups' ICEHCs in 2018. Consumption pattern is the predominant driver for promoting urban-rural middle-income groups' ICEHCs, whereas production structure is the predominant restraining driver. © 2023 International Energy Initiative},

This study leverages machine learning (ML), specifically projection pursuit regression (PPR), to evaluate the key factors that influence CO2 emission predictions in China. The analysis notably identifies the escalating electricity consumption as a primary influencing factor. Based on empirical findings, it is evident that building electricity consumption will continue to rise steadily until 2050 unless new restrictions or technological advancements are implemented. Relying solely on the reduced carbon intensity of electricity will not enable China to achieve carbon neutrality. Therefore, there is a pressing need for more energy-efficient building retrofits and technologies to reduce power consumption in both residential and commercial properties. This policy-oriented study underscores its practical implications, offering valuable insights to policymakers for developing targeted CO2 reduction strategies that align with sustainable development and climate goals. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Environmental quality has been pondered as an essential aspect of sustainable development across the global economies. Several factors such as economic development, income inequality, transportation, and environmental expenditures drastically influence environmental quality. More specifically, the transport sector is a major contributor to carbon emissions which deteriorate the environmental quality. Therefore, this study investigates whether economic development, transportation, environmental expenditures, and income inequality affect transport-carbon emissions for the OECD countries. Furthermore, panel time-series data period from 2000 to 2020 and cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag method are used for transport-oriented environmental examination. Results demonstrate that transportation upsurges transport-carbon emission level by 46.45% on average. Moreover, the joint effect of economic development and environmental taxes significantly reduces transport-carbon emissions by 14.70%. Findings further suggest that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between economic development and transport emission. Besides, income inequality, environmental expenditures, and green transportation are negatively associated with the coefficient of transport-carbon emissions. More interestingly, income inequality is negatively correlated with transport-carbon emissions across the sample countries. Furthermore, the joint effect of income inequality and economic development increases the emission level released by the transport sector. Thus, this research recommends some policies: countries should control traffic movements and increase environmental expenditures, and produce green transport vehicles to tackle environmental issues. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Current planning and design modes of dwellings and neighbourhoods are facing challenges of both philosophy and form. Past approaches no longer sustain new demands and require innovative thinking. The need for a new outlook is propelled by fundamental changes that touch upon environmental, economic and social aspects. The depletion of non-renewable natural resources, elevated levels of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change are a few of the environmental challenges that force designers to reconsider conceptual approaches in favour of ones that promote a better suitability between communities and nature. Consideration of overall planning concepts that minimize the development's carbon footprint, district heating, passive solar gain, net-zero residences and preserving the site's natural assets are some of the contemporary strategies that architects, planners and builders are integrating into their thought process and residential design practice. Increasing costs of material, labour, land and infrastructure have posed economic challenges with affordability being paramount among them. The need to do with less brings about concepts that include denser places, adaptable and expandable dwellings, and smaller-sized yet quality designed housing. Also, the need to reduce utility costs gave rise to better insulation, which benefits both the environment and the occupant. Social challenges are also drawing the attention of designers, builders and homeowners. As the "baby-boom" generation plans for retirement, housing an elderly population will take priority. Walkable communities, ageing in place and multigenerational living are some of the concepts considered. In addition, live-work environments have become part of the economic reality for those who wish to work from home - which has become possible through digital advances. The need to think innovatively about neighbourhoods led to the idea to write this book. The intention is to offer information on contemporary community design concepts and illustrate them with outstanding international examples. © Avi Friedman and Alexandra Pollock 2022.

In the 18 century, potatoes saved the European population from starvation, and since then, it has become one of the primary crops cultivated in countries such as Spain, France, Germany, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Potato production worldwide reached 368.8 million tonnes in 2019, 371.1 million tonnes in 2020, and 376.1 million tonnes in 2021, with production expected to grow alongside the worldwide population. However, the agricultural sector is currently suffering from urbanization. With the next generation of farmers relocating to cities, there is a diminishing and ageing agricultural workforce. Consequently, farms urgently need innovation, particularly from a technology perspective. As a result, this work is focused on reviewing the worldwide developments in potato harvesting, with an emphasis on mechatronics, the use of intelligent systems and the opportunities that arise from applications utilising the Internet of Things (IoT). Our work covers worldwide scientific publications in the last five years, sustained by public data made available from different governments.

In November 2021, the World Health Organization and partners launched the COP26 Health Programme for sustainable, climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems, and have since established the Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health to support its implementation. Given the wide variation in health financing, carbon emissions and unmet health needs across the world, fair sharing of the remaining carbon budget and health gains will be critical. In this Perspective, we explore the challenges and opportunities of healthcare decarbonization, outlining the principles of fair pathways to net-zero healthcare that are attentive to health and socioeconomic inequalities within and between countries. © 2023, Springer Nature America, Inc.},

	abstract = {There is strong scientific evidence to suggest that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are one of the key drivers of global warming. Rising CO2 emissions across the globe have been traced back to increasing global trade and rapid industrial development powered by fossil fuels. High CO2 emissions have had an adverse effect on the quality of life and economic growth of communities across the globe. In this study, the Granger causality approach is used to examine scientifically some causal relationships between energy consumption, CO2 emissions, economic growth, and key macroeconomic variables (trade openness and foreign direct investment) in the panel of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) countries. FATF countries are signatories to agreements to adhere to good financial practices to ensure sustainable development of their economies. The empirical analysis was conducted for the period 1980 to 2020. Results indicate a strong endogenous relationship between the variables in the short and long run. The analysis suggests that careful co-curation of economic, trade, energy, foreign direct investment, and environmental management policies is needed to ensure sustainable economic development in the FATF countries. Global trade and foreign direct investment policies must foster new environmental-friendly industries and greater use of clean renewable energy among these countries.

	abstract = {Much voluntary environmental action originates from civil society movements. This chapter will connect the environmental sustainability activity of households and civil society, to core economics: productive activity which sustains society but takes place outside markets and price mechanisms. Conventional finance assumes that Western economies are market economies. Consequently, the application of measures for valuing environmental related household production has hardly begun. While increasing attention is being paid to the valuations of natural capital and ecological services, little attention has been paid to valuing non-market environmental volunteering and action. The increasing use of satellite accounts - to measure the value of domestic, informal, community-based and volunteer production - has made it possible to estimate their levels of value and reciprocity to market economies. The current chapter examines a range of domains of environmental core economic activity, from membership and time given to environmental groups, through non-market green household production, in the spheres of energy, transport and food, to the health benefits of informal environmental activity. Important methodological issues surrounding measurement are raised. The predominate methodologies, of replacement and time-based opportunity cost valuations are utilised. This raises significant questions about valuing environmental engagement, in respect of overall societal sustainable development. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

The deliveries in dense cities cause several serious issues such as air/noise pollution and congestion. In this study, we compare the financial costs and CO2 emissions from different last mile delivery strategies of grocery bins in a scenario in Paris with four types of delivery vehicles (diesel/electric vans, cargo bikes, and autonomous delivery vehicles). We use costs associated with each vehicle type, location data with constraints for establishments in Paris, and delivery scenarios obtained by solving the vehicle routing problem for an overall cost comparison. We consider an economic analysis of the daily delivery to optimise the costs and estimate the CO2 emissions. The results highlight the competitiveness among last mile delivery and reflect the transition knowing the transport expenses since 2018: electric van costs become competitive with diesel ones, it concluded by some perspectives with cargo bikes and autonomous vehicles with their current limits. The strategies show a great impact on overall cost and emissions, which are vital in the development of sustainable urban last-mile delivery. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in cultivating fish, shellfish, and seaweeds in offshore waters. Existing pilot and commercial facilities demonstrate that offshore aquaculture is technically feasible, and that it can improve growing conditions and farmed animal health under some conditions. Many of the advances that have improved the ecological outcomes of nearshore aquaculture are likely to apply to offshore facilities as well. However, some ecological risks will likely persist in the near term. The vulnerability of offshore farm site infrastructure to weather events and vessel collisions could be similar to nearshore sites and result in escape events, and the farming of finfish will likely require feeds that include fishmeal and fish oil, ingredients derived from finite marine resources, and terrestrial-origin ingredients whose embodied carbon footprint may be high. Moreover, because offshore aquaculture occurs in ecological contexts that differ significantly from nearshore contexts, different kinds of ecological risks may also arise as the sector grows. Existing claims on marine space and conflicts with other uses could result in clustering of farms in favorable sites, posing a risk of cumulative impact. The transport, deployment, operation, and decommissioning of infrastructure associated with offshore farms may also pose ecological risks related to harmful interactions with marine wildlife (e.g., entanglement, vessel strikes, and habitat exclusion). Here we synthesize information on the ecological risks posed by offshore aquaculture and how to mitigate them. We also use this synthesis to identify knowledge gaps to inform the development of a research agenda and effective policies that can allow an offshore aquaculture industry to grow in the federal waters of the United States while minimizing environmental impact. © 2022 The Authors},

However, funding unfavourable environmental initiatives financially has prompted several concerns about establishing a clear connection between the environment and financial market items. The relationship between natural resources, technology and innovation for sustainable development in China from 2000 to 2021 is examined in this study. In order to investigate the highlighted link, the research makes use of a variety of econometric tools, including the Augmented Mean Group, Common Correlated Effects Mean Group and Driscoll-Kraay estimators. The cointegration findings based on Westerlund J. (2007) demonstrate that the study's specified variables have a long-run equilibrium connection across the examined time. According to empirical research, environmental deterioration is caused by technology, natural resources, foreign direct investment and total reserves, whereas technical innovation and renewable energy lower CO2 emissions. Additionally, the connection between technical innovation and industrial value-added has a detrimental effect on the ecology in the Chinese provinces. Based on these findings, China's provinces are urged to promote green technology development while maintaining the bloc's high environmental protection standards.

	abstract = {We must move toward electrification of the transportation sector to help mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. Carbon emission reduction in long-haul freight transport should be developed and administered given it accounts for 22% of transportation related emissions worldwide. Although electrified transport can make tail-pipe vehicle carbon emissions negligible, it does not mean that the entire system that supports electrified transport is carbon-neutral. We address this latter point in the present study by conducting a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of long-haul electric trucks that are powered by overhead cable lines (OCL). The environmental impacts were compared with those of battery electric vehicle trucks (BEV), and conventional diesel-powered trucks. The techno-economic analysis of long-haul freight OCL technology was conducted based on data from pilot-scale studies in Germany. The feasibility of implementing this technology in other countries was examined by comparing environmental impacts across respective electricity mixes. Results show that the environmental and economic impacts of OCL technology depends on the adoption percent. After analyzing different adoption rate scenarios, OCL adoption was found to be economically and environmentally beneficial at the 10% adoption rate or higher. We also found that use phase electricity accounts for over 83% of the net greenhouse gas emissions, thereby making the electricity mix powering this technology a determining factor for implementation around the world. Across their life cycles, the carbon footprint of both OCL and BEV was 2.5 times lesser than that of the conventional truck. Other findings reveal adaptable methods, a unique environmental-to-economic ratio measure, and equity considerations that can be leveraged for immediate decision-making activities and future studies alike. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Building on insights from ecological economics and philosophy of technology, this book offers a novel, interdisciplinary approach to understand the contradictory nature of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. PV technology is rapidly emerging as a cost-effective option in the world economy. However, reports about miserable working conditions, environmentally deleterious mineral extraction and toxic waste dumps corrode the image of a problem-free future based on solar power. Against this backdrop, Andreas Roos explores whether 'ecologically unequal exchange' - an asymmetric transfer of labor time and natural resources - is a necessary condition for solar PV development. He demonstrates how the massive increase in solar PV installation over recent years would not have been possible without significant wage/price differences in the world economy - notably between Europe/North America and Asia - and concludes that solar PV development is currently contingent on environmental injustices in the world economy. As a solution, Roos argues that solar technology is best coupled with strategies for degrowth and counter-metabolic alliances, which allow for a transition away from fossil fuels and toward a socially just and ecologically sustainable future. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of solar power, philosophy of technology, and environmental justice. © 2023 Andreas Roos The right of Andreas Roos to be identifed as author of this work has been asserted in accordance with sections 77 and 78 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.

To this end, this study combines input–output analysis and structural decomposition analysis techniques to develop an analytical framework that examines how final demand affects wage changes in tourism-characteristic sectors through industrial linkage mechanisms. The empirical results from China show that the differential contributions of final demand, industrial linkages, and the share of labour returns to sectoral wage changes are the key factors explaining the differences in wage growth across tourism-characteristic sectors in China from 2002 to 2017. For most tourism-characteristic sectors in China, increased consumption and reduced share of labour returns are the main contributors to wage premiums and discounts, but the magnitude of their effects varies across sectors. The production structure effect and import substitution effect present more pronounced sectoral differences in terms of the direction of their effects. © 2022 The Authors},

This study investigated the effects of tea waste compost on the growth traits of Raphanus sativus L. or radish while exploring the contribution of clean source carbon dioxide to sustainable production. The research team gathered the tea waste from urban households and allowed it to decompose for four months. Certain volumes of the tea waste compost ranging from 0% to 75% were mixed with locally available loamy textured garden soil (v/v). To simulate the impact of carbon dioxide waste from urban households on plant growth, the first greenhouse was enriched with carbon dioxide to reach elevated concentrations of 1500 ± 100 ppm, while the second greenhouse was maintained at the ambient level of 500 ± 20 ppm. The optimal growth temperature of both greenhouses was supplied with electricity. Using a split plot design, the effects of normal and elevated carbon dioxide levels, different volumes of tea waste compost, and the combined effect of tea waste compost and carbon dioxide levels on growth traits were investigated. The results showed that the elevated carbon dioxide level negatively influences the radish yield, biomass accumulation, and vegetative growth parameters. However, the tea waste compost improves growth traits with increasing volumes in garden soil from 0% to 75% (v/v). In the media containing 75% of tea waste compost, the elevated carbon dioxide level has the same effect as the normal level on growth traits, however, positive effects on total fresh weight but negative effects on measures of total dry weight, leaf dry weight, and total leaf area. These results show that the highest volume of tea waste compost ideally supports the growth of radish, which is mainly related to its high nitrogen content. The high and normal carbon dioxide levels in this volume are unable to dominate each other in terms of growth promotion. However, to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from houses and to produce fresh products, the waste carbon dioxide of urban houses should be transferred to the greenhouse to provide radishes with higher carbon dioxide levels during photosynthesis. Renewable energy sources such as solar or wind-generated electricity can be used to increase the temperature to the optimal level. This production method should be evaluated in future studies for other horticultural crops that prefer high carbon dioxide levels. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The bioeconomy seeks to efficiently transform biomaterials into value-added products to achieve circularity. A circular bioeconomy is a circular carbon economy based on bio-based resources. There is a dearth of information in the literature about how psychological factors affect public acceptance of the bioeconomy, especially in Africa, where the adoption of bioeconomy is scant. Addressing this gap, this study characterized bioeconomy as a low-carbon bio-based technological innovation to combat climate change and developed the Bioeconomy Technology Acceptance Model (BTAM) to explain the effects of individual-level factors on public acceptance of bioeconomy and investigated it in a survey (N = 465) using questionnaires that were carried out in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2022. The respondents were chosen by proportional stratified random sampling, and descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and structural equation modeling were used to analyze the data obtained. The strong influence of perceived usefulness from bioeconomy and intention to accept bioeconomy in BTAM suggests that the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is suitable for predicting public acceptance of bioeconomy. Considering the strong influence of belief about climate change on the perceived usefulness of bioeconomy and intention to accept it in this study, it is imperative to promote climate change education among Africans to accelerate acceptance of bioeconomy on the continent. The identified psychological factors provide a reference for scholars, policymakers, and manufacturers to effectively develop individual-oriented intervention strategies and promotion schemes to enhance acceptance of bioeconomy in Africa in particular and other climes where there is not yet widespread acceptance of circular bioeconomy.

Our socio-technical analysis, based on the Sectoral Innovation Systems and the Systems Failure framework, aims to capture existing and potential drivers of or barriers to diffusion of sustainable industrial technologies and extract implications for policy. Results indicate that actor structures and inconsistent policies have limited low-carbon innovation. A critical factor for the successful decarbonisation of German industry lies in overcoming lobbying and resistance to technological innovation caused by strong networks. By contrast, a key to UK industrial decarbonisation is to drive innovation and investment in the context of an industry in decline and in light of Brexit-related uncertainty. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) concentrations vary between countries with similar carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which can be partially explained by differences in air pollution control efficacy. However, no indicator of air pollution control efficacy has yet been developed. We aimed to develop such an indicator, and to evaluate its global and temporal distribution and its association with country-level health metrics. A novel indicator, ambient population-weighted average PM2.5 concentration per unit per capita CO2 emission (PM2.5/CO2), was developed to assess country-specific air pollution control efficacy (abbreviated as APCI). We estimated and mapped the global average distribution of APCI and its changes during 2000–2016 across 196 countries. Pearson correlation coefficients and Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) were used to evaluate the relationship between APCI and health metrics. APCI varied by country with an inverse association with economic development. APCI showed an almost stable trend globally from 2000 to 2016, with the low-income groups increased and several countries (China, India, Bangladesh) decreased. The Pearson correlation coefficients between APCI and life expectancy at birth (LE), infant-mortality rate (IMR), under-five year of age mortality rate (U5MR) and logarithm of per capita GDP (LPGDP) were −0.57, 0.65, 0.66, −0.59 respectively (all P values < 0.001). APCI could explain international variation of LE, IMR and U5MR. The associations between APCI and LE, IMR, U5MR were independent of per capita GDP and climatic factors. We consider APCI to be a good indicator for air pollution control efficacy given its relation to important population health indicators. Our findings provide a new metric to interpret health inequity across the globe from the point of climate change and air pollution control efficacy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

We bring together and develop the concepts of ‘qualification’ and ‘assetization’ to analyse how decarbonizing capital is proceeding. With specific reference to green bonds and the equities of fossil fuel corporations, we show how investment and divestment entail the qualification of things as assets with more-or-less specific carbon properties. But the qualification of assets as ‘low-’ or ‘high-carbon’ is also shown to be contingent, contested and compromised, featuring contrasting modalities of qualification that are decarbonizing capital in uncertain and incomplete ways. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Electronic waste (e-waste) is a rapidly developing environmental problem particularly for the most developed countries. There are technological solutions for processing it, but these are costly, and the cheaper option for most developed countries has been to export most of the waste to less developed countries. There are various laws and policies for regulating the processing of e-waste at different governance scales such as the international Basel Convention, the regional Bamoko Convention, and various national laws. However, many of the regulations are not fully implemented and there is substantial financial pressure to maintain the jobs created for processing e-waste. Mexico, Brazil, Ghana Nigeria, India, and China have been selected for a more detailed study of the transboundary movements of e-waste. This includes a systematic review of existing literature, the application of the Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, Response (DPSIR) framework for analysing complex problems associated with social ecological systems, and the application of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for evaluating the environmental impact of electronic devices from their manufacture through to their final disposal. Japan, Italy, Switzerland, and Norway have been selected for the LCA to show how e-waste is diverted to developing countries, as there is not sufficient data available for the assessment from the selected developing countries. GOOD, BAD and UGLY outcomes have been identified from this study: the GOOD is the creation of jobs and the use of e-waste as a source of raw materials; the BAD is the exacerbation of the already poor environmental conditions in developing countries; the UGLY is the negative impact on the health of workers processing e-waste due to a wide range of toxic components in this waste. There are a number of management options that are available to reduce the impact of the BAD and the UGLY, such as adopting the concept of a circular economy, urban mining, reducing loopholes and improving existing policies and regulations, as well as reducing the disparity in income between the top and bottom of the management hierarchy for e-waste disposal. The overarching message is a request for developed countries to help developing countries in the fight against e-waste, rather than exporting their environmental problems to these poorer regions. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Current statistics report that 2.6 billion households across the globe rely on polluting and inefficient cooking fuels and technologies, posing death-threatening health risks to people mainly from developing countries/regions. Several studies on clean cooking have been conducted with the emergence of international organizations such as the Clean Cooking Alliance to raise awareness. In the current study, a bibliometric tool, CiteSpace, was employed to analyze the 877 documents retrieved from the SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, and A&HCI databases on clean cooking research from 1990 to 2020. The results reveal that interest in clean cooking research took a sharp rise in the last decade, especially after 2016. The research field has become increasingly interdisciplinary but has mostly centered on environment, energy, and health. The most productive countries/regions in this field are the USA, India, England, and China. The keyword and citation analyses indicate that research in this field mostly focuses on adverse impacts of household air pollution from unclean cooking fuels and technologies on the environment and public health particularly, in developing countries/regions. Also, the drivers and barriers to the large-scale adoption of clean cooking fuels and technologies have become a topic of interest in recent years. The three most studied clean cooking fuels among various regions are LPG, biogas, and electricity. This study synthesizes global research on clean cooking and may be beneficial to other researchers in understanding current trends in this field and serve as a guide for concentrating on the most important topics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

However, outliers in this theoretical disposition make empirical proof of the fuel subsidy-carbon intensity apt and primitive. Despite established fuel subsidy abolishment gains for climate and economic welfare, the relevance, magnitude and policy implications remain dimly. This paper employs the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) estimation procedure to gauge the contemporaneous influence of fuel subsidy for carbon intensity in Nigeria. Findings revealed that fuel subsidy removal inversely relates to Nigeria’s carbon emission in the short run and long run. The study recommends a complementary policy option that ensures additional financial savings to the government should be invested in public sector growth that can cushion the effect of relative income loss to the citizenry. The Nigerian government should ensure measures are kept in place to discourage overconsumption of alternative energy (for example coal) that could also threaten the green economy paradox. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

For the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, we estimated the burden of each vehicle fleet on population health in the units of years of life lost and premature deaths. We then assessed the separate health benefits of electrifying private vehicles, transit buses, and replacing the oldest commercial vehicles with newer trucks. A complete deployment of electric passenger vehicles would lead to health benefits similar to replacing all trucks older than 8 years (i.e., about 300 premature deaths prevented) in the first year of implementation; however, GHG emissions would be mainly reduced with passenger fleet electrification. Transit bus electrification has similar health benefits as electrifying half of the passenger fleet (i.e., about 150 premature deaths prevented); however, the GHG emission reductions reached under the bus electrification scenario are lower by 90%. By accelerating policies to electrify cars and buses and renew older trucks, governments can save hundreds of lives per year and mitigate the impacts of climate change.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The development of Chinese society needs the support of a perfect and efficient freight transport system. Nonetheless, China's freight system is facing a major challenge in reducing carbon emissions. Hence, firstly, this paper explores three major internal drivers of carbon emissions by analyzing the current situation in China's freight system: proportion of railway freight (PORF), railway electrification level (REL) and electric truck penetration (ETP). Secondly, the system dynamics (SDs) model is used to simulate the carbon emission system of freight transportation in China. Thirdly, this paper sets 13 scenarios of carbon peaking to explore the paths of carbon peaking before 2030 under the three levels of development of ETP oriented freight system. The results indicate that when PORF, REL, and ETP reach 23.96% of total freight volume, 83.7% of rail freight, and 11% of truck freight in 2030 respectively, China's freight system has the most optimistic scenario of carbon peaking. Meanwhile, the time of carbon peaking is 2024, and the peak value is 0.842 billion tons. When PORF, REL, and ETP reach 15.96% of total freight volume, 63.7% of rail freight, and 3% of truck freight in 2030 respectively, China's freight system has the worst scenario of carbon peaking. Meanwhile, the time of carbon peaking is 2029, and the peak value is 1.016 billion tons. Also, it is proved that improving PORF, REL, and ETP is an effective way to achieve green and sustainable development of China's freight industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy is considered environmentally friendly than fossil fuel sources, and geothermal power plants are expected to have a low carbon footprint. It is renewable that can last million years. There exist, however, several gases stored under the earth’s surface which are released into the atmosphere during digging (TWI 2020). This research paper aims at monitoring the potential positive and negative effects of geothermal on environmental quality (CO2 emissions) in the USA for the period January 1980 to August 2019. The paper employed wavelet and partial wavelet coherence computations to explore the impacts of geothermal energy usage on the environment. The concluding remarks from the estimations can be classified into short-term (1–3-year cycle) results and long-term (3–8-year cycle) results. It is found in the short term that (i) geothermal usage increased CO2 emissions during 1980–1983 and 1993–1997 and (ii) CO2 emissions caused geothermal usage to increase for the period 2000–2009 and after 2015. The paper reveals also that in the long term, (a) geothermal energy consumption increased CO2 emissions during the periods 1985–1990, 1993–1996, and 2013–2016 and (b) geothermal energy consumption decreased CO2 emissions for the period 1996–2008 in the USA. This research work eventually yields some relevant geothermal energy policy suggestions for US policymakers to make geothermal more environmentally friendly. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Cities are increasingly advancing multiple societal goals related to environmental sustainability, health, well-being, and equity. However, there are few comprehensive data sets that address social inequality and equity across multiple infrastructure sectors, determinants, and outcomes, particularly at fine intra-urban spatial scales. This paper: (1) Offers an overarching conceptualization of inequality and equity in multi-sector urban systems; (2) Introduces a broad data framework to assess inequality and equity across social (S), ecological (E), infrastructural (I), and urban (U) form determinants (SEIU) and environment (E), health (H), well-being (W), and economy and security (E) outcomes (EHWE), identifying a universe of >110 SEIU–EHWE data layers (variables) of interest; (3) Provides an illustrative data case study of a US city that synthesizes publicly available sources of the associated SEIU–EHWE data attributes, noting their availability/gaps at fine spatial scales, important to inform social inequality; (4) Discusses analytic methods to quantify inequality and spatial correlates across SEIU determinants and EHWE outcomes; and, (5) Demonstrates several use-cases of the data framework and companion analytic methods through real-world applied case studies that inform equity planning in applications ranging from energy sector investments to air pollution and health. The US data case study reveals data availability (covering 41 of the 113 data layers) as well as major gaps associated with EHWE outcomes at fine spatial scales, while the application examples demonstrate practical use. Overall, the SEIU–EHWE data framework provides an anchor for systematically gathering, analyzing, and informing multiple dimensions of inequality and equity in sustainable urban systems. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in cities. Multiple strategies including transport management, urban planning and behavioral changes are required to reduce GHG emissions. Considering the urgent need to improve to urban jobs-housing relationship and reduce transport carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, we propose a complex system model that couples multi-agent based models (ABM) and system dynamics (SD) models to simulate the impact of jobs-housing relationship adjustment policies on CO2 emissions from urban transport. Through simulation of the jobs-housing relationship and comprehensive intelligent simulation of multi-scenario policy schemes, the best optimal combination of schemes is investigated. Results show that the implementation of a single policy and measure can reduce some transport CO2 emissions, but they still rise, and do not reach a peak. To address possible future development of Beijing, three scenarios for transport CO2 emissions reduction were designed, which include Business as usual scenario (BAU), Plan scenario (PS) and Integrated scenario (IS), respectively. Under the IS, carbon intensity could be reduced by 25%–55% compared with 2005, and the environmental economic benefits of each combination scheme were higher than the single measure. Further, we investigated the effects of a reduction in carbon intensity of 65% in 2050 compared to 2005, by simulating 3 different integrated schemes (Combination Scheme Six (CSSI), Combination Scheme Seven (CSSE) and Combination Scheme Eight (CSEI)). This approach showed that CO2 emissions reduction and environmental economic benefits of the CSEI scheme were greater than either of the other two schemes. Therefore, the CSEI scheme is the best optimal development path in an integrated scenario from the long-term goal, and the research results provide decision-making reference and research support for Beijing to achieve low-carbon transportation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The next decade will be decisive in the fight against climate change. It will be impossible to hold the planet to a 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise without controlling methane and carbon dioxide emissions from the oil and gas sector. Contrary to popular belief, the world will not run out of these resources anytime soon. Instead, oil and gas are becoming more climate-intensive to supply using technologies like fracking oil and liquefying gas-even as these abundant resources continue to be used to fuel cars, heat homes, and produce consumer goods like shampoo, pajamas, and paint. Policymakers, financial investors, environmental advocates, and citizens need to understand what oils and fossil fuels are doing to our climate to inform decision-making. In No Standard Oil, Deborah Gordon shows that no two oils or gases are environmentally alike. Each has a distinct, quantifiable climate impact. While all oils and gases pollute, some are much worse for the climate than others. In clear, accessible language, Gordon explains the results of the Oil Climate Index Plus Gas (OCI+), an innovative, open-source model that estimates global oil and gas greenhouse gas emissions. Gordon identifies the oils and gases from every region of the globe-along with the specific production, processing, and refining activities-that are the most damaging to the planet and proposes innovative solutions to reduce their climate footprints. Global climate stabilization cannot afford to wait for oil and gas to run out. No Standard Oil shows how people can take immediate, practical steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the crucial oil and gas sector while making sustainable progress in transitioning to a carbon-free energy future. © Oxford University Press 2022.

	abstract = {The food sector includes several large industries such as canned food, pasta, flour, frozen products, and beverages. Those industries transform agricultural raw materials into added-value products. The fruit and vegetable industry is the largest and fastest-growing segment of the world agricultural production market, which commercialize various products such as juices, jams, and dehydrated products, followed by the cereal industry products such as chocolate, beer, and vegetable oils are produced. Similarly, the root and tuber industry produces flours and starches essential for the daily diet due to their high carbohydrate content. However, the processing of these foods generates a large amount of waste several times improperly disposed of in landfills. Due to the increase in the world's population, the indiscriminate use of natural resources generates waste and food supply limitations due to the scarcity of resources, increasing hunger worldwide. The circular economy offers various tools for raising awareness for the recovery of waste, one of the best alternatives to mitigate the excessive consumption of raw materials and reduce waste. The loss and waste of food as a raw material offers bioactive compounds, enzymes, and nutrients that add value to the food cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. This paper systematically reviewed literature with different food loss and waste by-products as animal feed, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products that strongly contribute to the paradigm shift to a circular economy. Additionally, this review compiles studies related to the integral recovery of by-products from the processing of fruits, vegetables, tubers, cereals, and legumes from the food industry, with the potential in SARS-CoV-2 disease and bacterial diseases treatment.  © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Pasture-based animal production is a determinant in shaping biomes worldwide, with historical and cultural effects. It affects land use, landscapes, ecosystem conservation, and climate change. Converting forages into high-value-food livestock production evolved as essential for human nutrition and health, economics, and poverty reduction. A better understanding of the interactions of livestock with the environment to fundament alternatives to mitigate impacts of beef production comes up against the scarcity of studies on the environmental impact of livestock systems that include estimates of biodiversity and the availability of specific indicators. In this work, we provide elements to support the proposition of sustainable practices, looking at cow-calf production in different Brazilian biomes to estimate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use (LU) amidst diverse levels of biodiversity conservation. GHG emissions and LU were analyzed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. We express the level of biodiversity conservation as average scores (1 = low conservation to 5 = high conservation) of four indicators: native vegetation, monocultures, soil organic carbon, and endangered fauna and flora species in each biome. Respectively in the Amazon, Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal, GHG emissions were 7.14, 6.54, 9.10, and 13.49 kg of CO2 equivalent *kg of live weight gain (LWG)−1, the LU was 89.30, 87.94, 158.84, and 307.24 m2y *kg LWG−1, and the mean biodiversity scores were 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.3. These results demonstrate that the proposed indicators were able to show differences in biodiversity between the studied systems consistent with current scientific knowledge. This information contributes to the definition of different production priorities according to the peculiarities and current levels of biodiversity conservation in each biome. Holistic management and different pasture improvement strategies have been suggested to increase production, decrease environmental impacts, and regenerate ecosystems. Thus, new opportunities arise to mitigate impacts without generating other problems, increase income, improve the quality of life, and preserve sensitive areas that make up the diversity of Brazilian biomes. © 2022},

	abstract = {Emissions from transportation have a severe impact on the current climate crisis. Therefore, the estimation of these pollutants requires precise measurements that integrate both traffic and vehicle fleet information within a specific country or area. However, the current estimation tools continue using vehicle fleet standards based on recommendations or local studies. A problem for the current estimation models arises due to the difficulty of centralizing the large number of vehicle statistics. This article has taken advantage of the capabilities of both visual programming tools and building information modeling (BIM) to centralize databases from different sources, generating a model that integrates current traffic data and vehicle fleet statistics. The proposed platform estimates emissions and the carbon footprint using TIER 1 emission factors recommended by the European Environmental Agency (EEA). This platform has been successfully applied to a case study to estimate the carbon footprint of the B-20 road in Barcelona, using current vehicle restriction scenarios. This case study presents a maximum difference of-2.72% compared with the estimations made by another similar report. This proposed platform more completely automates the communication among the equations and databases required to estimate traffic road emissions.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Contemporary systems of transport have become dependent on fossil fuels, with road transport reliant mainly on petrol/gasoline and diesel-powered internal combustion engines. The primary focus on energy supply has neglected the important role of energy demand in efforts to reduce transport-related emissions, which contribute to both global climate change and localized air pollution. Transport planning plays an important role in determining potential transport futures. This chapter points to the different ways that the process of planning and the decisions made by planners (in relation to other actors) can reinforce the dominance of private-car based environments, or contribute to the transition toward a more diverse system of mobility. In short, alternative transport futures—built on alternative energy systems—are possible, but implementation will be challenged by a range of vested interests and status quo thinking which planners—and others—must seek to overcome. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This second edition is structured by clearly defined chapters based on specific wetland types (e.g. Peatlands, Mangroves) and with a consistent and coherent organization for ease of discoverability. The table of contents is divided into four main subjects: Foundations, Restoration of Freshwater Wetlands, Restoration of Estuarine Wetlands, and From Theory to Practice, each with multiple chapters. Part 1, Foundations, contains chapters describing definitions of wetlands, ecological theory used to guide restoration, and considerations on where to implement restoration on the landscape. In Parts 2 and 3, restoration of specific freshwater (marshes, forests, peatlands) and estuarine (tidal marshes, mangroves) wetlands are described. Part 4, From Theory to Practice, contains chapters describing performance standards to gauge success of projects and case studies describing small-scale and large-scale restoration projects of various freshwater and estuarine wetlands. Each chapter contains clearly labeled sections which assist the reader to quickly and easily key in on the subject matter that they are seeking. The approach of Creating and Restoring Wetlands is unique in that, in each chapter, it links ecological theory important to ecosystem restoration with practical techniques to undertake and implement successful wetland restoration projects, including recommendations for performance standards to gauge success as well as realistic expectations and timescales for achieving success. Each chapter ends with a summary table describing keys to ensure success for a given wetland ecosystem. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Challenges of population growth, urban overpopulation, climate change and declining natural resources are pushing food supply systems to their limits. Therefore, urban areas are adopting different/alternative food production and distribution systems, like urban agriculture (UA). UA uses modern/innovative technologies that shorten food supply systems, and this results in mitigating not only the financial burden of modern farming but also climate change effects. With all its implicit and explicit effects, UA offers different food sources for growing urban populations, and it could provide a way of life that is capable of responding to global challenges. Explicit effects of UA often cause misunderstanding of this concept, so UA is often seen as small-scale production, inefficient and limited, which in turn diminish the mitigating effects of UA. Misunderstanding of UA is particularly high in transitional countries, and therefore, this study in Bosnia and Herzegovina aimed to determine the level of understanding of the UA concept and people’s expectations of UA, as well as to identify factors that constrain people’s awareness of the concept and its mitigating impacts on climate change. The study mapped the existing Bosnia and Herzegovina UA value chain, and lays out perspectives for UA development and the impact of the 2020 COVID-19 crisis on people’s perceptions of UA. Finally, we offer our recommendation for all stakeholders to support the UA movement to combat global food supply challenges and help mitigate environmental issues connected with food consumption by urban populations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Much of the literature on mitigation pathways addresses technological and economic aspects of feasibility, but overlooks the behavioral, cultural, and social factors that affect theoretical and practical mitigation pathways. We present a tripartite framework that “unpacks” the concept of mitigation pathways by distinguishing three factors that together determine actual mitigation: technical potential, initiative feasibility, and behavioral plasticity. The framework aims to integrate and streamline heterogeneous disciplinary research traditions toward a more comprehensive and transparent approach that will facilitate learning across disciplines and enable mitigation pathways to more fully reflect available knowledge. We offer three suggestions for integrating the tripartite framework into current research on climate change mitigation. Most research on pathways to mitigating climate change has concentrated on technological and economic aspects of feasibility with limited consideration of the behavioral, cultural, and social factors that also affect the feasibility of mitigation. In this Perspective, we present a tripartite framework that “unpacks” the concept of mitigation pathways by distinguishing three factors that together determine actual mitigation: technical potential, initiative feasibility, and behavioral plasticity. We offer suggestions for integrating the tripartite framework into current research on climate change mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite four decades of delay and even rollback in many countries, this “post-political” stance remains nearly universal among many natural scientists and educators (Dunlap & Brulle, 2015). To social scientists, in particular sociologists, it should be clear that economics and politics are central to climate change: to its causes, its consequences, and to the difficulty of mustering adequate climate action. Scientific facts are indispensable, but deeper understandings of the social systems and structures in which climate change has emerged as an issue and in which it is addressed are just as urgently needed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Climate change is a leading challenge for world society today. Global climate action so far has proved unable to meet the moment. The reason for the current policy impasse is that we treat climate change as an environmental problem instead of an energy problem. Once we switch perspectives, we can see that we are trapped in an energy trilemma - caught between energy equity, energy security, and environmental sustainability. We can only resolve the trilemma when we balance the three limbs against each other. I propose that a commons governance approach can achieve this goal. For any such approach to work, we must rely heavily on one of today 's great bugbears: economic globalization. I submit that the existing legal framework supporting globalization, known as Washington Consensus instruments, can in fact be fused with the global climate framework under the Paris Agreement to give rise to a "Parisian Consensus " on global energy governance. This Parisian Consensus builds on an existing global legal infrastructure to slingshot us past the current climate impasse. It differs from existing approaches to climate governance by insisting upon a developmental imperative: we must expand, rather than restrict, energy access to create an energy infrastructure capable of supporting equitable development. I submit that this development perspective can succeed where existing approaches have stalled: generating realistic buy-in for a global, sustainable energy future. © 2022 Columbia Law Review Association.

	abstract = {An estimated 8 million metric tons (MMT) of plastic waste enters the world's ocean each year - the equivalent of dumping a garbage truck of plastic waste into the ocean every minute. Plastic waste is now found in almost every marine habitat, from the ocean surface to deep sea sediments to the ocean's vast mid-water region, as well as the Great Lakes. This report responds to a request in the bipartisan Save Our Seas 2.0 Act for a scientific synthesis of the role of the United States both in contributing to and responding to global ocean plastic waste. The United States is a major producer of plastics and in 2016, generated more plastic waste by weight and per capita than any other nation. Although the U.S. solid waste management system is advanced, it is not sufficient to deter leakage into the environment. Reckoning with the U.S. Role in Global Ocean Plastic Waste calls for a national strategy by the end of 2022 to reduce the nation's contribution to global ocean plastic waste at every step - from production to its entry into the environment - including by substantially reducing U.S. solid waste generation. This report also recommends a nationally-coordinated and expanded monitoring system to track plastic pollution in order to understand the scales and sources of U.S. plastic waste, set reduction and management priorities, and measure progress. © 2022 by the National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Psychology for Sustainability applies psychological science to so-called environmental problems that manifest when human behavior disrupts and degrades natural systems. Drawing on environmental psychology, ecopsychology, conservation psychology, and related disciplines, the authors provide an extensive review of relevant theory and research in a lively and easy-to-read style. This edition represents a substantial revision and expansion spurred by a burgeoning body of research and by global ecological, political, and social developments. Particular attention is paid to environmental justice and collective action for systems change. More than one-third of the content is entirely new, and there are more than nine hundred new references. This edition also features a new full-color design and over two hundred full-color fgures, tables, and photos. Timely topics include climate change, biodiversity loss, environmental racism, Indigenous perspectives, social media, and COVID-19 and other pandemics. Content retained from the previous edition has been updated throughout. The twelve chapters are organized into four parts: 1.What on Earth Are We Doing includes a prologue on psychology as a sustainability science, followed by three chapters that provide an overview of the ecological crisis and its historical origins and offer a vision for a sustainable future. 2.Psychology for a Sustainable Future encompasses fve chapters on research methods, theory, and fndings pertinent to understanding and shifting unsustainable behavior. 3.What’s Good for the Planet Is Good for Us includes two chapters that address the reciprocal relationship between planetary health and human health. 4.Being the Change We Want to See introduces two new chapters to inspire readers to take what they have learned and apply it as changemakers in the world. The frst is about collective action for systemic change. The second presents a positive psychology perspective on how to tackle the ecological crisis in a way that promotes wellbeing and resilience and is personally meaningful and fulflling. Carefully tailored to the length of a standard college semester, Psychology for Sustainability is essential reading for courses on sustainability across disciplines. It will be invaluable to people outside academia as well, including policymakers, legislators, and those working on building sustainable communities. The text is also supplemented by online resources for instructors.},

	abstract = {Understanding how urbanisation and industrialisation interact with carbon emissions (CEs) among different regions informs the approaches for achieving emissions reduction targets and promoting regional economic development. However, this topic has not been adequately addressed in previous studies. Therefore, it is of great significance to conduct an empirical investigation of the interactions between urbanisation, industrialisation and CEs. Aided by the gravity model, the barycentre trajectories of urbanisation, industrialisation and CEs are analysed. Additionally, the total transfer amounts of industry and CEs are quantitatively examined by using an improved shift-share analysis method, and the spatial aggregation features of urbanisation, industrialisation and CEs are elucidated by constructing a three-dimensional (3D) contribution matrix model. The key conclusions are as follows: (1) The barycentre of industrialisation and urbanisation migrated to the southwest, while that of CE migrated to the northwest and the speed of this movement was faster than that of urbanisation and industrialisation. (2) Industrial transfer mainly occurred in 2005–2012, while the turning point of industrial upgrading appeared in 2013. Furthermore, midwestern regions mainly underwent industrial transfer, while northwest regions always showed CEs transfer from 2005 to 2016. (3) To achieve coordination among urbanisation, industrialisation and emission reductions, 30 provinces are grouped into 8 types according to the 3D contribution matrix model, and optimisation strategies are proposed to highlight regional disparities. These findings have significant implications for making informed decisions regarding urbanisation and industrialisation development as well as emissions-reduction policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Policy makers need access to reliable data to monitor and evaluate the progress of development outcomes and targets such as sustainable development outcomes (SDGs). However, significant data and evidence gaps remain. Lack of resources, limited capacity within governments and logistical difficulties in collecting data are some of the reasons for the data gaps. Big data—that is digitally generated, passively produced and automatically collected—offers a great potential for answering some of the data needs. Satellite and sensors, mobile phone call detail records, online transactions and search data, and social media are some of the examples of big data. Integrating big data with the traditional household surveys and administrative data can complement data availability, quality, granularity, accuracy and frequency, and help measure development outcomes temporally and spatially in a number of new ways.The study maps different sources of big data onto development outcomes (based on SDGs) to identify current evidence base, use and the gaps. The map provides a visual overview of existing and ongoing studies. This study also discusses the risks, biases and ethical challenges in using big data for measuring and evaluating development outcomes. The study is a valuable resource for evaluators, researchers, funders, policymakers and practitioners in their effort to contributing to evidence informed policy making and in achieving the SDGs. Objectives: Identify and appraise rigorous impact evaluations (IEs), systematic reviews and the studies that have innovatively used big data to measure any development outcomes with special reference to difficult contexts. Search Methods: A number of general and specialised data bases and reporsitories of organisations were searched using keywords related to big data by an information specialist. Selection Criteria: The studies were selected on basis of whether they used big data sources to measure or evaluate development outcomes. Data Collection and Analysis: Data collection was conducted using a data extraction tool and all extracted data was entered into excel and then analysed using Stata. The data analysis involved looking at trends and descriptive statistics only. Main Results: The search yielded over 17,000 records, which we then screened down to 437 studies which became the foundation of our systematic map. We found that overall, there is a sizable and rapidly growing number of measurement studies using big data but a much smaller number of IEs. We also see that the bulk of the big data sources are machine-generated (mostly satellites) represented in the light blue. We find that satellite data was used in over 70% of the measurement studies and in over 80% of the IEs. Authors' Conclusions: This map gives us a sense that there is a lot of work being done to develop appropriate measures using big data which could subsequently be used in IEs. Information on costs, ethics, transparency is lacking in the studies and more work is needed in this area to understand the efficacies related to the use of big data. There are a number of outcomes which are not being studied using big data, either due to the lack to applicability such as education or due to lack of awareness about the new methods and data sources. The map points to a number of gaps as well as opportunities where future researchers can conduct research. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is a globally recognized threat multiplier. Yet, decades of intergovernmental negotiations have failed to curb toxic levels of fossil fuel energy-related air pollution which the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified as the world's largest, single environmental health risk. Lying in plain view are the troubling truths about the morbidity and ill-health burdens associated with anthropogenic climate change that are borne by those who have done the least to contribute to per capita emissions of greenhouse gas emissions. Ignoring the nexus between air pollution, lack of access to clean energy and climate adversities represents a collective failure of the UN's ambitious, universally agreed upon 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda (SDA) which pledged 'to leave no one behind'. This book highlights the air pollution crisis that emanates from the heavy reliance on polluting forms of energy and the urbanization of poverty in developing countries. It provides a framework for understanding why the broader sustainable development community needs to address the more neglected intersection between adverse climatic impacts and energy-related air pollution which devastates the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable amongst us, especially young children, women and the elderly. It focuses on the importance of breaking down persistent global silos and goals on sustainable energy for all, and climate change reflected in the UN's 2030 SDA, and the 2015 Paris Agreement. Integrating clean air and climate mitigation measures that specifically include curbing short lived climate pollutants such as black carbon via innovative partnerships/modalities are seen as vital to clean energy and climate responsive action. This book argues that linked actions by non-nation state actors aimed at reducing air pollution and ameliorating short term climate pollutants in the most populous cities, particularly in countries like India where annual average particulate matter pollution levels consistently exceed WHO guidelines are essential in reducing grave health costs and disease burdens. Air Pollution, Clean Energy and Climate Change will be of particular interest to policy makers, researchers, environmental advocates, civil society stakeholders and practitioners who want to understand the urgency of addressing linkages between climate change, fossil fuel energy, air pollution and public health risks. The cover image is an oil painting by Anilla Cherian, which incorporates tree bark and twigs, and serves as a reminder of the daily energy sources used by millions who lack access to clean energy and are exposed to high levels of household air pollution.

	abstract = {Valladolid (Spain) is a medium-size city (~300,000 inhabitants) that established a greenhouse (GHG) emissions reduction target in 2011 of 20% from 2010–2020. However, tracking the evolution of GHG in medium-size cities is challenging due to the general lack of compulsory data collection at this scale and issues with boundaries when attempting alternative estimates. Here, we propose and apply a novel method to estimate the evolution of GHG emissions due to energy consumption for the period of 2010–2019 in Valladolid, combining top-down and bottom-up data following a physical energy flows approach. The energy consumption of the city is estimated by main sectors and types of energies. The results show that, throughout the past decade, both total energy consumption and its sector end-use share did not significantly change: final energy consumption remained at around 24 MWh (86.5 GJ) per capita and was still highly dependent on fossil fuels, especially natural gas and oil products (over 70% of total energy supply). The GHG reduction by 2019 was ~11% with relation to 2010 and, thus, had not reached the set objective; in per capita terms, the GHG reduction was lower (~6%) due to population loss during the period. The trend, however, has not been monotone and has instead followed a U-shape strongly correlated with the economic crisis and subsequent recovery, suggesting that transition policies have had, at most, a modest effect on the overall results. The analysis shows, first of all, the limitations of statistical sources at a local level, both for energy and mobility, which do not allow more accurate results in identifying the main energy consumers to be reached; and, secondly, the need for strong decarbonization measures which have to be set urgently at all the relevant institutional levels. Reaching GHG neutrality in the city by 2050 requires reducing the GHG emissions by ~13%/year, which is ~20 times faster than for the 2010–2019 average of 0.6%/year. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Following the actual pace of industrial development, due to the ever-growing tech- and resource-savvy society, unprecedented waste amounts are generated on a daily basis. Therefore, “waste-to-energy” (WtE) techniques appear as a possible approach to convert solid residues into energy, within more energy-efficient processes to emit less or no CO2. Plasma gasification constitutes a proficient and clean alternative with multiple environmental gains, simultaneously reducing or eliminating toxicity and pollution issues while avoiding the landfilling of huge amounts of residues. To evaluate the performance of this WtE treatment, the life cycle thinking (LCT) methodology gathers useful impact assessment tools, providing quantifiable indicators on multiple domains. The lack of works reporting the combined assessment of the environmental, technical, economic and social spheres of WtE has been previously noticed and, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no such review so far for plasma gasification. This work proposes a deep review of literature on the life cycle assessment, life cycle costing and social impact assessment of plasma gasification, to evaluate how LCT tools are applied to the energetic valorization of solid residues by this technique, as a measure of sustainability. This provides insights on the contribution of energy recovery as a circular strategy, diverting waste from open dumps or landfills, while producing renewable energy and/or by-products that will replace the use of virgin materials. Herein, an attempt to complement the knowledge in the sectors of renewable energies and waste management is conducted, to support the fulfillment of circular economy goals and contribute to a more sustainable society and way of living. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services (ES) has risen to prominence based on its promise to vastly improve environmental decision-making and to represent nature's many benefits to people. Yet the field has continued to be plagued by fundamental concerns, leading some to believe that the field of ES must mature or be replaced. In this paper, we quantitatively survey a stratified random sample of more than 1,000 articles addressing ES across three decades of scholarship. Our purpose is to examine the field's attention to common critiques regarding insufficient credible valuations of realistic changes to services; an unjustified preoccupation with monetary valuation; and too little social and policy research (e.g. questions of access to and demand for services). We found that very little of the ES literature includes valuation of biophysical change (2.4%), despite many biophysical studies of services (24%). An initially small but substantially rising number of papers address crucial policy (14%) and social dimensions, including access, demand and the social consequences of change (5.8%). As well, recent years have seen a significant increase in non-monetary valuation (from 0% to 2.5%). Ecosystem service research has, we summarize, evolved in meaningful ways. But some of its goals remain unmet, despite the promise to improve environmental decisions, in part because of a continued pre-occupation with numerical valuation often without appropriate biophysical grounding. Here we call for a next generation of research: Integrative biophysical-social research that characterizes ES change, and is coupled with multi-metric and qualitative valuation, and context-appropriate decision-making.

The twin processes of planning and property development are inextricably linked - it is not possible to carry out a development strategy without an understanding of the planning process, and, equally, planners need to know how real estate developers do their job. The planning system is explained, from the increasing emphasis on spatial planning at a national, local, and neighbourhood level down to the detailed perspective of the development management process and the specialist requirements of historic buildings and conservation areas. At the same time, the authors explain the entire development process from inception, through appraisal, valuation, and financing, to completion. Sustainability and corporate social responsibility and their impact on planning and development are covered in detail, and the future consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are explored in new opening and closing chapters setting the text in a global context. Written by a team of authors with many years of academic, professional, and research experience, and illustrated throughout with practical case studies and follow-up resources, this book is an invaluable textbook for real estate and planning students and helps to meet the requirements of the RICS and RTPI Assessment of Professional Competence. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

	abstract = {Award-winning author David J. Park argues that the battle against global warming is also a fight for media reform. With his new book Media Reform and the Climate Emergency: Rethinking Communication in the Struggle for a Sustainable Future, he critically examines how advertising, the digital infrastructure, and journalism advance the climate emergency and lays out a path of reform to help create a more sustainable world. The production and consumption of goods and services within consumer societies lead to unsustainable greenhouse gas emissions, and Park finds that much of mass communication is either dependent upon or closely tied to the success of this social organization. As a result, he suggests successful environmental movements creatively dismantle or reform institutional infrastructures that extend the planetary global warming crisis and the unsustainable consumption of nature. Communication policies and industries are part of these infrastructures. Advertising evolved to propel a new consumer society that would encourage the over-consumption of goods and services with harmful and unsustainable production processes. Our digital infrastructure is largely premised upon the surveillance of online consumer habits and preferences, with the goal to create individualized messages to more effectively persuade people to increase their consumption habits. Much of commercial journalism resists the drastic and immediate regulatory changes necessary to address the worst aspects of this crisis. This is because so many of the needed changes challenge the media’s source of income, their libertarian philosophy, and the general status quo, which is preferred by elites. Bound to foster conversations among scholars, activists, politicians, and those who work in the communication industries, this book rethinks mass communication and highlights how immediate reform is needed in the struggle for a sustainable planet. © 2021 by David J.

Special attention　has been given to a chapter on the role radioactivity plays in everyday　life applications...Generally the book is well produced and will be a valuable resource...Many lectures can be lightened up by including material from this work. Summing up: RECOMMENDED. Upper division undergraduates through professionals; technical program students." U. Greife, Colorado School of Mines, USA "I found the biographical accounts of the various stalwarts of Physics inspirational. Most of them, if not all, had to overcome economic hardships or p[ersonal tragedies or had to do their groundbreaking　work in the face of tyranny and war. The biographies also highlighted the high standards of moral convictions that the scientists had as they realized the grave implications of some of their work and the potential threats to humanity. This ought to inspire and motivate young men and women aspiring to be physicists. Even people who have been in the field for a while should find your book re-energizing.

	abstract = {Urban mobility plays an important role in addressing urban livability. The complexification and dispersion of travel due to the improvement of transport and the multiplication of our daily living places underline the relevance of multilevel territorial planning, recognizing that the knowledge of local differences is essential for more effective urban policies. This paper aims (1) to comprehend conceptually how urban mobility contributes to the urban livability from the local to metropolitan level and (2) to assess the previous relation toward a livable metropolis based on the readily available statistics for the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. Hence, a triangulation between conceptual, political/operative, and quantitative/monitoring approaches is required. The methodology follows four steps: (1) literature review focusing on the quantification of urban mobility within the urban livability approach; (2) data collection from the Portuguese statistics system; (3) data analysis and results, using principal component analysis (PCA) followed by cluster analysis (CA); (4) discussion and conclusions. In Portugal, although it is implicit, consistency is evident between the premises of recent urban mobility policies and respective planning instruments, such as the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP), and the premises of urban livability as an urban movement. Focusing on the national statistics system, the available indicators that meet our quality criteria are scarce and represent a reduced number of domains. Even so, they allow identifying intra-metropolitan differences in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA) that could support multilevel planning instruments. The results identified five principal components related to commuting at the local and intermunicipal level, including car use as well as social and environmental externalities, and they reorganized the 18 LMA municipalities into eight groups, clearly isolating Lisbon, the capital, from the others. The identification of sensitive territories and respective problems based on urban livability principles is fundamental for an effective urban planning from livable communities to livable metropolis. © 2021 by the authors.

One strategy for circular cities is to reintroduce manufacturing into urban areas (or “urban manufacturing”), allowing resource flows to be localized at the city scale. However, the extent to which urban manufacturing contributes to circular cities is unclear in existing literature. The purpose of this paper is therefore twofold: to understand whether urban manufacturing could contribute to the circular economy, and to understand the drivers and barriers to circular urban manufacturing. By reviewing existing literature and interviewing experts, we identified the caveats for the contribution of urban manufacturing to circular cities, as well as the spatial, social, and material-related drivers and barriers for circular urban manufacturing. © 2020 by the authors.

Depending on the intensity of the construction activities, there are many CWHTs in operation, imposing massive impacts on a region’s transportation system and natural environment. However, such impacts have rarely been documented. This paper has analyzed CWHTs’ freight characteristics and their carbon emission by harnessing a big dataset of 112,942 construction waste transport trips in Hong Kong in May 2015. It has been observed that CWHTs generate 4,544 daily trips with 307.64 tons CO2-eq emitted on working days, and 553 daily trips emitting 28.78 tons CO2-eq on non-working days. Freight carbon emission has been found to be related to the vehicle type, transporting weight, and trip length, while the trip length is the most influential metric to carbon emission. This research contributes to the understanding of freight characteristics by exploiting a valuable big dataset and providing important benchmarking metrics for monitoring the effectiveness of policy interventions related to construction waste transportation planning and carbon emission. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Road freight transportation literature increasingly concentrates on environmental aspects to reduce logistics contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. Some literature reviews highlight specific mitigation and adaptation strategies, but the overarching research directions to identify emerging areas and general trends of the field have not yet been clustered or synthesized. This paper presents a systematic quantitative review of the road freight transportation decarbonization literature leveraging bibliographic coupling and network analysis techniques. It contributes to the understanding of road freight decarbonization and provides recommendations for further investigations of the field by systematically mapping the literature body. This way, key research clusters are outlined and visualized to understand the underlying knowledge structure. The findings reveal a diverse and fast-growing research field, which in large parts focuses on route optimizations, last-mile solutions, and alternative fuels, while offering future research opportunities that address organizational barriers currently hindering collaboration and technological or operational measures for long- haul transportations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study presents the results of an integrated model developed to evaluate the environmental and health impacts of Electric Vehicle (EV) deployment in a large metropolitan area. The model combines a high-resolution chemical transport model with an emission inventory established with detailed transportation and power plant information, as well as a framework to characterize and monetize the health impacts. Our study is set in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) in Canada with bounding scenarios for 25% and 100% EV penetration rates. Our results indicate that even with the worst-case assumptions for EV electricity supply (100% natural gas), vehicle electrification can deliver substantial health benefits in the GTHA, equivalent to reductions of about 50 and 260 premature deaths per year for 25% and 100% EV penetration, compared to the base case scenario. If EVs are charged with renewable energy sources only, then electrifying all passenger vehicles can prevent 330 premature deaths per year, which is equivalent to $3.8 Billion (2016$CAD) in social benefits. When the benefit of EV deployment is normalized per vehicle, it is higher than most incentives provided by the government, indicating that EV incentives can generate high social benefits. Main conclusion: Our results indicate that even with the worst-case assumptions for EV electricity supply (100% natural gas), vehicle electrification can deliver substantial health benefits in Toronto region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Despite urgent need for climate action, denial of climate change and resulting absence of appropriate pro-environmental behavior are widespread. Interpretive (recognition of climate change as a problem but re-interpretation of its severity) and implicatory denial of climate change (recognition of climate change as a problem but denial of psychological, political, and moral implications) can be interpreted as self-protective strategies people use to protect the self in the face of threat. However, research has not integrated individual self-protective strategies into one comprehensive measure. The present research aimed at reviewing the existing literature and constructing the Climate Self-Protection Scale (CSPS) to make climate-relevant defensive self-protection measurable. In Study 1, N = 354 Germans responded to a pool of items. Using exploratory main axis analysis, we identified five factors, corresponding to the self-protective strategies rationalization of own involvement, avoidance, denial of personal outcome severity, denial of global outcome severity, and denial of guilt. Study 2 (N = 453 Germans) used confirmatory factor analysis to verify the five-factorial structure of the CSPS. Self-protective strategies were positively related with each other (except for avoidance and denial of guilt) and fit into a framework of interpretive (denial of global and personal outcome severity) and implicatory denial (rationalization, avoidance, denial of guilt). They related positively to male gender and right-wing political orientation, and negatively to various indicators of pro-environmentalism. This provides evidence of criterion and construct validity of the CSPS. In future research, the scale could be used as a tool to examine climate-relevant self-protective strategies further. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Transitioning German road transport partially to hydrogen energy is among the possibilities being discussed to help meet national climate targets. This study investigates impacts of a hypothetical, complete transition from conventionally-fueled to hydrogen-powered German transport through representative scenarios. Our results show that German emissions change between −179 and +95 MtCO2eq annually, depending on the scenario, with renewable-powered electrolysis leading to the greatest emissions reduction, while electrolysis using the fossil-intense current electricity mix leads to the greatest increase. German energy emissions of regulated pollutants decrease significantly, indicating the potential for simultaneous air quality improvements. Vehicular hydrogen demand is 1000 PJ annually, requiring 446–525 TWh for electrolysis, hydrogen transport and storage, which could be supplied by future German renewable generation, supporting the potential for CO2-free hydrogen traffic and increased energy security. Thus hydrogen-powered transport could contribute significantly to climate and air quality goals, warranting further research and political discussion about this possibility. © 2020 The Authors},

Through document analysis and interviews with industry associations in Australia, this article seeks to demonstrate the pliability of just transition, a plasticity that allows incumbent business interests to ‘remake’ what is just within a just transition. Underpinning this analysis is a novel theoretical framework based on ‘justification of worth’, which shows that fossil capital seeks to outmaneuver calls for just transition by discursively re-aligning justice with the ‘common good’ of fossil capital hegemony. The article therefore assists scholars of international political economy to understand the discursive strategies through which powerful incumbent actors endeavor to maintain fossil capital hegemony in response to justice focused counter-hegemonies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Context: The U.S. food supply system relies heavily on vertically-integrated food supply chains (FSCs), which leverage large-scale production, streamlined operations, and centralized planning and control to provide consumers with a consistent supply of food. However, these FSCs were seriously disrupted upon the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. During the height of the crisis, they were slow to respond to production system failures and sudden and widespread changes in consumer demand. By contrast, many regionalized food supply chains (RFSCs) proved to be adaptive and responsive to changes in demand and delivery requirements, quickly pivoting to distribute products directly to consumers safely. Objective: The objective of this research is to explore how RFSCs can improve the resilience of the U.S. food supply system in the face of large-scale disruptions like the COVID-19 crisis. In particular, this research seeks to gain a greater understanding of how RFSCs can leverage logistics best practices for efficient and reliable distribution to consumers in normal times and during disasters. Methods: This study presents seven case studies of RFSCs in Texas and Iowa that adopted logistics best practices to enable them to provide their customers with convenient and safe purchasing mechanisms during the COVID-19 emergency. A description of how the strategies adopted by each participant promote the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development goals is provided. Results and conclusions: The successes experienced by these farmers and distributors at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic were a consequence of their willingness to adopt new distribution and logistics strategies. Collaboration among RFSC actors was a particularly effective strategy, as well as the adoption of scale-appropriate information and communication technologies, which helped to facilitate collaboration. Further, these case studies demonstrate how improved logistics performance allowed RFSCs to contribute to the health and well-being of their communities in a time of need. Significance: These case studies demonstrate the potential of RFSCs to support a resilient and socially-sustainable food system that communities can rely on, even in the face of a major disruption like COVID-19. The adoption of logistics best practices helped these RFSCs to develop new organizational strengths that will likely support sustainable development in their communities after the crisis ends. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Food e-commerce has seen significant growth over the past decade that accelerated after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last-mile transportation and logistics are widely considered the most expensive and least efficient portion of the supply chain and have multiple important energy trade-offs such as cargo capacity and consumer density. Last-mile transportation energy use in rural areas is underrepresented in the literature. This study proposes a hybrid agent-based and discrete event model framework for evaluating the last-mile transportation energy use of van- and car-based food delivery services in a rural community, based on meal-kit and grocery delivery operations, respectively. This framework quantifies last-mile energy use in rural areas, and is demonstrated here using a neighborhood outside of Austin, TX as an analytical testbed. The study focuses on the effects of consumer density, cargo limitations, and vehicle speed. For the conditions examined with this framework, diesel delivery vans use more total energy than passenger cars for the same trip, though a van delivering four orders uses less energy per-order than a car delivering one order. However, there are trade-offs between vehicle type and mileage, cargo capacity, route density, and speed that are particularly important for delivery services operating in rural areas. This framework can be used by service providers to assess route-specific trade-offs for each vehicle and gauge which is preferable for given operating conditions or to evaluate the energy, and thus also cost, impact of expanding their services to rural areas. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Ecological modernisation in the form of support to the notion of green growth remains the dominant discourse in environmental policy globally. Still, questions of limits to economic expansion and growth on a planet with finite natural resources have been at the core of environmental discourses at least since the 1970's. A recent effort by Stoknes and Rockström (2018) seeks to unite notions of ecological limits with the concept of green growth by proposing genuine green growth as denoting a situation when growth respects planetary boundaries. Focusing on recent trajectories in emissions intensity, they highlight Nordic countries including Denmark as examples of such genuine green growth. In this article, we demonstrate that the specific conceptualization of genuine green growth and resulting claims about the Nordic countries rest on particular assumptions, specifically concerning national-level carbon accounting frameworks and the size of the remaining global carbon budget. By opening up these assumptions for analysis we illustrate the partiality and potentially misleading nature of the conceptualization of GGG. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Ship-borne air emissions have a significant impact on air pollution as well as global warming, especially in coastal areas. CO2 is the major component of the greenhouse gases (GHGs). Naval vessels constitute a notable part of the total fleet of sea going ships and the fuel burnt in the energy systems of naval vessels is strongly proportional to CO2 emissions. Existing fossil fuel reserves are apparently decreasing, so interrelated fuel efficiency and emissions should be handled together. The increasing need for ensuring safety at sea and protecting sea resources, results in an increase in the need to build new vessels that will provide these missions. Offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) are reasonable solutions to perform these missions compared to naval vessels such as frigates and corvettes, in terms of high investment and life cycle costs. Main air emission source of an OPV is energy system which consists of prime movers and auxiliary engines. This system should comply with mission profile assigned to OPV, providing high fuel efficiency and low air emission. This study analyzes fuel efficiency and proposes an approach for estimation of CO2 emissions of four alternative energy systems for a new generation OPV at the conceptual design phase. © 2021 Parlar Scientific Publications.

Design/methodology/approach: We conduct a stated-preference survey and apply McNemar test on the collected data. Findings: The results show that displaying the environmental and social impacts of last-mile deliveries influences E-commerce customers, and generally makes them more likely to choose a more sustainable last-mile delivery. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations are (1) the possible inconsistency between participants' intentions stated in the survey and their actual behaviour in real life and (2) the possibility of participants denying socially undesirable behaviours. Further research can study e-commerce customers' real behaviour. Practical implications: E-retailers and logistics companies could implement transparent information sharing on the delivery sustainability impact on all three sustainability pillars. Social implications: The suggested transparent information sharing has the potential to change customers' behaviours towards more sustainable deliveries. Originality/value: We provide a new approach in investigating customers' preferences on last-mile deliveries, by giving E-customers the chance of making choices between different deliveries, not only based on the economic factors (as in common practice nowadays) but also based on the environmental and social factors. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The monetary system is the indispensable missing link in the debate of sustainability, and whether the current financial system can handle these evolved needs. To date, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) primarily have been financed either through the private sector, through conventional public sector taxes and fees, or through philanthropic commitment. Assuming a need of 4 to 5 trillion dollars annually in the 10 to 15 years left to finance our future, these conventional sources of finance are insufficient in terms of both the scale and speed of funding required to finance our future. Furthermore, the inherent instability of our financial system forces the world community to focus first and foremost on repairing and stabilizing the existing system. The development of cryptocurrencies using distributed ledger technologies (mainly blockchain) has prompted leading central banks to study the potential application of this approach to independently create purchasing power. In this vein, this book offers a new approach, namely introducing a parallel electronic currency specifically designed to finance global common goods and provide the resources necessary to achieve the SDGs. Furthermore, this mechanism would have a stabilizing effect on the existing monetary system. The book argues that one way this could be achieved is by giving central banks a modified monetary mandate to inject new liquidity into the system using a top-down approach. Alternatively, liquidity could come from corporate or communal initiatives with crypto- or communal currencies in a bottom-up approach. The author maintains that by issuing a blockchain-enabled parallel electronic currency earmarked for SDG-related projects and using other channels for monetary flow rather than the conventional ones, the future could be financed in a different manner. In the long run, abandoning our current monetary monoculture and introducing a monetary ecosystem would stabilize international financial markets, increase monetary regulatory efforts, reduce negative externalities, create a social Pareto optimum and stabilize democracies. This book presents, in the same spirit as Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics, a Tao of finance-an outside-of-the-box approach to financing global common goods. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021, corrected publication 2021.

	abstract = {Reducing environmental impacts in transport motivates many studies to offer more sustainable freight services. However, most methodologies focus on impacts from fuel consumption, and approaches trying to integrate other transport components have not facilitated its application to actual and specific transport services. In this study, we present a harmonized approach to address the transport services with a holistic way to increase the knowledge about hotspots of the transport sector based on the life cycle assessment methodology. In this framework, vehicle manufacturing, fuel production, and infrastructure construction are the key transport components around the traffic process. Besides fuel usage, the operation and maintenance of vehicles and infrastructures are also included. We developed a tool to create the life cycle inventories for each transport component to be applied to specific transport services in any location with a comprehensive view and low uncertainty in the results. This approach was applied to road-freight services in Colombia, Malaysia, and Spain. The main results showed the nature and origin of the environmental impacts, which are highly influenced by the emissions control technologies, road characteristics, and traffic volume. The contribution of atmospheric pollutants per tonne-km can decrease by a quarter when Euro VI trucks on highways instead of conventional trucks on single-lane roads are used. However, these contributions are highly affected by fuel production due to the origin of biofuels. The proposed methodology provides relevant information to estimate transport impacts in the life cycle assessment of products with superior precision and identify strategies for systemically improving sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Synthetic fuels derived from renewable energies can act as energy storage media, thus mitigating the effects of fossil fuels on environment and health.

Nitrogen-based fuels pose one possible synthetic fuel pathway. In this review, we discuss the progress and current research on utilization of nitrogen-based fuels in power applications, covering the complete fuel cycle. We cover the production, distribution, and storage of nitrogen-based fuels. We assess much of the existing literature on the reactions involved in the ammonia to nitrogen atom pathway in nitrogen-based fuel combustion. Furthermore, we discuss nitrogen-based fuel applications ranging from combustion engines to gas turbines, as well as their exploitation by suggested end-uses. Thereby, we evaluate the potential opportunities and challenges of expanding the role of nitrogen-based molecules in the energy sector, outlining their use as energy carriers in relevant fields.

This study employs the residual-based Kao and Westerlund cointegration technique to find long-run cointegration, and continuously updated bias-corrected (CUP-BC) and continuously updated fully modified (CUP-FM) methods to check the long-run elasticities between the variables. The long-run estimators’ findings suggest a positive and significant impact of road transport intensity, road passenger transport, road freight transport on road transport CO2 emissions. Economic growth and urbanization are significant contributing factors in road transport CO2 emissions, while trade openness and crude oil price significantly reduce road transport CO2 emissions. The Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality test results disclose unidirectional causality from road transport intensity and road transport freight to the road transport CO2 emissions. However, the causality between road passenger transport and road transport CO2 emissions is bidirectional.

	abstract = {This book addresses the life quality of the average adult in the world, based on international data weighted according to national population size. It rests on the theoretical framework of analytic-functionalism to explain statics and dynamics in the production of life quality. The statics means the influences of personal and national factors on life quality, whereas the dynamics mean the changes in the influences over time. This approach elucidates life quality at the personal level rather than at the national level, which overlooks what happens to the average person living in the world. The approach involves a broad view of the production of life quality, including experiences, practices, and appraisals of life. This production also involves personal background characteristics and the national indicators of modernization, globalization, and environmental issues. Knowledge about the production is helpful for policymakers, researchers, students, and other people to upgrade life quality. Such knowledge is valuable because it is up-to-date, generalizable, and sensible based on the analytic-functionalist theoretical framework and statistical estimation. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

	abstract = {Recognizing that climate politics has been an increasingly contentious and heated topic in Australia over the past two decades, this book examines Australian capitalism as a driver of climate change and the nexus between the corporations and Coalition and Australian Labor parties. As a highly developed country, Australia is punching above its weight in terms of contributing to greenhouse gas emissions despite rising temperatures, droughts, water shortages and raging bushfires, storm surges and flooding, and the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. Drawing upon both archival and ethnographic research, Hans Baer examines Australian climate politics at the margins, namely the Greens, the labour union, the environmental NGOs, and the grass-roots climate movement. Adopting a climate justice perspective which calls for "system change, not climate change" as opposed to the conventional approach of seeking to mitigate emissions through market mechanisms and techno-fixes, particularly renewable energy sources, this book posits system-challenging transitional steps to shift Australia toward an eco-socialist vision in keeping with a burgeoning global socio-ecological revolution. Accessibly written and including an interview with renowned comedian and climate activist Rod Quantock OAM, this book is essential reading for academics, students and general readers with an interest in climate change and climate activism. © 2022 Hans A.

This paper presents the methodology for developing a four‐stage macroscopic model of bicycle traffic for the city of Gdynia, and its use in planning new bicycle routes, considering a modal shift. The model presented in this paper allows for the evaluation of the influence of the characteristics of the cycling infrastructure, along with the development of the cycling network based on the choice of cycling as an alternative to other modes of transport, by taking into account the modal shift. The model takes into account the influence of the longitudinal gradient, link, and surface type of cycling routes on the distribution and demand for bicycle traffic. The results of our research allow us to assess the impact of planned cycling routes on the reduction in the volume of car traffic, which is crucial for reducing energy consumption and negative environmental impacts. Experiences from the application of the model in Gdynia suggest that the model provides a strong basis to support mobility planning and monitoring processes in cities worldwide. Cities should take into account the methods proposed in this paper when planning the development of their transport systems. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Food loss (wasted and spoiled food) increases the burden on resources and environmental impacts throughout the entire food chain. This study describes and deploys a model and identifies data sources for estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with food loss from farm production, delivery and refrigeration, retail sale, household consumption, and waste management in the United States using four California-grown high-value produce as case studies. The ratios of food wasted to food produced are 50%, 60%, 50%, and 64% for avocados, celery, lemons, and strawberries, respectively, and the differences are largely influenced by consumer-level and on-farm food loss. From the consumption perspective, this means, for example, that 1.8 units of strawberries are wasted for every unit consumed. The packaging material is a significant environmental offender, contributing, e.g. 52% to the total emissions (without food loss) for strawberries. End-of-life analysis of wasted food and packaging covers the common waste management practices: landfilling, composting, anaerobic digestion, incineration, and recycling. Uncertainties in the data are assessed through Monte Carlo simulation. With the consideration of food loss, the total GHG emissions from the entire life cycle of strawberries, celery, avocados, and lemons increase by 93%, 62%, 56%, and 53% to 0.26, 0.038, 0.061, and 0.058 kg CO2 eq. per one serving size, respectively. Emissions from the annually wasted strawberries, avocados, celery, and lemons in California amount to 76, 24, 12, and 12 000 tons of CO2 eq., respectively. Fourteen percent of the world's population could have a serving of strawberries just from the annually wasted strawberries in California. However, wasteful consumer action can be even more significant. Emissions from a typical driving scenario to a store to purchase only one produce exceeds the emissions associated with all four produce combined. Reducing food waste during consumption and the environmental impacts of packaging should be prioritized. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

As collective guilt and shame are likely to be most controversial to readers and have the least evidence in the previously examined data, Chapter 5 supplements the sources examined in Chapter 2, with additional popular and academic literature about collective guilt and shame, particularly claims about the human species in Anthropocene literature and the existence of naming and shaming campaigns which target governments and corporations judged to contribute to environmental degradation. The presence of so many forms of environmental guilt and shame in popular culture indicate that a multifaceted response to these moral emotions and the actions and conditions that give rise to them is necessary. © Sarah E.

The book begins by examining the food economy, with chapters focusing on foodscapes, the financialization of food, and a new chapter dedicated to food and nutrition (in)security. In Part II, the book addresses community and culture. While some books only look at the interrelationships between food and culture, this section problematizes the food system from the standpoint of marginalized bodies. It contains chapters focusing on agricultural and food labor and the peasantries, topics which are often overlooked, and gender, ethnicity, and poverty. Part III examines food and the environment, with chapters addressing important topics such as agro-ecosystems, food justice, sustainable food, and agriculture and food sovereignty. The final part focuses on food futures and includes a brand-new chapter on sustainable diets and ethical consumption. The book concludes by showcasing how we can rethink food production and consumption in a way that can help heal social, political, and cultural divisions. All chapters draw on international case studies and include learning objectives, suggested discussion questions, and recommendations for further reading to aid student learning.

	abstract = {Waste-to-energy treatment is an efficient energy recovery method and an important countermeasure against global warming. The supply of steam from waste treatment plants to industrial sectors presents a higher energy recovery efficiency than traditional waste-to-energy methods. However, its technical potential and economic benefits are not fully understood by policymakers. Furthermore, the regional characteristics and effects of neighboring land use, which affect the heat supply and demand, are not commonly analyzed. Therefore, this study evaluates the spatial steam demand of industries in the Aichi Prefecture by using the steam demand unit value per production shipment and the spatial value of manufactured goods shipments. In addition, this study evaluates the steam supply potential from waste treatment plants to industrial sectors based on the estimated spatial steam demand and the transportable distances. The results show that the steam supply from waste treatment plants to the industries has a great physical potential in Aichi Prefecture. From a cost–benefit perspective, plans considering a 1 km range can be profitable, but the profitability decreases as the distance increases and the no-profitability mesh number increases. To improve the energy recovery efficiency from waste, the location of waste treatment plant should be changed, and the efficiency of steam transport on both supply and demand sides should be increased. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

De-spite this growing interest in AFS, comprehensive analyses of the scholarly literature are hard to find. Therefore, the present systematic review delineated the contours of this growing research strand and analyzed how it relates to sustainability. A search performed on the Web of Science in January 2020 yielded 1389 documents, and 1289 were selected and underwent bibliometric and topical analyses. The topical analysis was informed by the SAFA (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems) approach of FAO and structured along four dimensions viz. environment, economy, society and culture, and policy and governance. The review shows an increasing interest in AFS with an exponential increase in publications number. However, the study field is north-biased and dominated by researchers and organizations from developed countries. Moreover, the analysis suggests that while environmental aspects are sufficiently addressed, social, economic, and political ones are generally overlooked. The paper ends by providing directions for future research and listing some topics to be integrated into a comprehensive, multidisciplinary agenda addressing the multifaceted (un)sustainability of AFS. It makes the case for adopting a holistic, 4‐P (planet, people, profit, policy) approach in agri‐food system studies. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This book critically analyses the prospects of overhauling the legal framework of climate change regulation of corporations in African state. It adopts the dilute interventionism regulatory framework to tackle the culture of regulatory resistance by corporations in Africa. Over the course of this volume, Kikelomo O. Kila critiques the climate change legal framework in all 53 African states and conducts an in-depth case study of the two largest economies in Africa - Nigeria and South Africa - to highlight the commonality of the problems in Africa and the potential for the dilute interventionism paradigm to significantly address these problems. The book establishes why African states should directly intervene through legislative mechanisms to compel corporations to incorporate climate change mitigation in their business activities. It proposes that this direct intervention should comprise a blend of prescriptive and facilitative mechanisms structured in a dilute interventionism regulatory model. Overall, this volume argues that implementing this model requires the institution of a strong and independent regulator with a veto firewall protection system that guarantees its de facto independence from government and external influences. Corporate Regulation for Climate Change Mitigation in Africa will be of great interest to climate change stakeholders at the international, regional, and domestic levels, policymakers, regulatory practitioners, and legal experts on corporate regulation. It will also be an insightful resource for students and scholars of climate change and environmental law, policy, and governance. © 2023 Kikelomo O. Kila.},

	abstract = {Last-mile deliveries usually occur within urban areas where logistics operations increase congestion and emissions, as well as associated roadway-related health impacts. This paper evaluates the role of incentives for zero and near-zero emission vehicle (ZEV) technologies in last-mile delivery operations. Specifically, the study investigates the total cost of ownership and life cycle environmental impacts associated with last-mile deliveries, and compares the private and public costs of different vehicle powertrain and fuel pathways, under existing incentives in the State of California. The study analyzes driving patterns for several last-mile delivery vocations, including beverage, warehouse, parcel, grocery, food and local deliveries based on real-world truck travel data. Statistical analyses are conducted to compare driving patterns across vocations, vehicle classes, and powertrains, as well as across parcel carrier fleets. To better assess the role of the incentives, the study also provides a comparative estimate of the marginal health damages from life cycle emissions of criteria pollutants (e.g. $/ton). Our results suggest that parcel deliveries are characterized by short trips (95% less than 100 miles), a high number of stops, and lower average driving speeds compared to other delivery vocations. Total cost of ownership for conventional diesel Class 3 to 6 vehicles used in last mile applications were estimated to be approximately between $282 and $305 thousand dollars, with the cost of negative health impacts ranging from $38 to $64 thousand dollars over the vehicle lifetime. The results show that battery electric freight vehicles are cost competitive with conventional diesel vehicles, particularly for smaller (Class 3) light commercial vehicles. Available financial incentives were sufficient to offset additional purchase and fuel expenses, leading to lower total costs of ownership. © 2021},

The results show that sustainable technological innovations and smart applications of insurance and financial services help decrease GHG emissions in the lowest to highest quantile distribution. In contrast, air transportation freight, air freight pricing, and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows escalate GHG emissions due to unsustainable logistics activities, inefficient freight pricing,and dirty production, which confirmed the ‘pollution haven’ hypothesis across countries. The impact of air freight revenues has a differential impact on GHG emissions in the different quantiles’ distribution, as in the lowest quantiles (i.e., τ0.2 to τ0.4), air freight revenues increase GHG, whereas, at the highest quantiles’ distribution (i.e., τ0.9) emissions decrease. Thus, the viability of air freight revenues is further assessed using Panel Granger causality and panel innovation matrix. The results show the bidirectional causality between i) air freight pricing and GHG emissions, ii) air transportation freight (and freight pricing, freight revenues, FDI) and technology innovations, iii) FDI and air freight revenues, while there is a unidirectional causality running from i) insurance and financial services to GHG emissions, ii) GHG emissions to technological innovations and FDI inflows, and iii) air transportation freight to FDI inflows © 2022 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de Ciencias de la Atmósfera y Cambio Climático.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)},

There is a visible effort to make the urban last-mile (LM) deliveries more sustainable, mainly in the environmental aspects; however, the related literature lacks a synthesis of the up-to-date research trends and available solutions. This paper reviews relevant literature following SRL methodology in terms of topics related to green LM deliveries on the e-commerce market in urban areas, and identifies trends and the research gaps in this field. In addition, current research topics and existing solutions within the e-commerce market, which increase its environmental sustainability are presented. The findings provide an accurate and comprehensive synthesis of research in green LM e-commerce deliveries in cities, identify current and emerging interests of researchers worldwide, and discover areas requiring further studies. The topics of ICT and smart solutions, customer behavior, and performance assessment certainly seem to be underestimated in the current research. In practical terms, it is a source of knowledge and guidelines on the current developments regarding the existing solution for the LM e-commerce deliveries in the urban area, which might help local governments, freight operators, and other stakeholders of last-mile logistics to improve their sustainability. © 2021 by the author.

Yet despite clear signals, we are slow to act in a meaningful way, despite the fact that we have the legal, political, and technological tools to transition our economies to net zero carbon. While some businesses are reluctant to take significant steps to reduce their carbon footprint, many companies are well-intentioned but feel somewhat paralysed in the face of overwhelming data that portend a financially and environmentally devastating future. Yet we can still reverse the trajectory of climate change, but it requires bold and informed action to reduce our carbon footprint in a manner that embeds fairness in the transition. This book offers a guide for companies, pension funds, asset managers, and other institutional investors to commence the legal, governance, and financial strategies needed for effective climate mitigation and adaptation, and to help distribute the economic benefits of these actions to their stakeholders. It takes the reader from ideas to action, from first steps to a more meaningful contribution to the move towards a ‘climate positive’ circular economy. It can also serve as a helpful guide to everyone implicated in a corporation’s activities-employees, pensioners, consumers, banks and other lenders, policy-makers, and community members. It offers insights into what we should be expecting, and asking, of these individuals who have taken responsibility for effectively managing our savings, our retirement funds, our investments, and our tax dollars. © Janis Sarra 2020.},

Further climate change impacts are inevitable; however, their damage to marine organisms and ecosystems, and the services they provide, can be greatly reduced if greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly reduced. This review covers six main climate-related drivers (warming, acidification, deoxygenation, sea level rise and storm events, sea ice loss, stratification, and nutrient supply) and their impacts on 13 marine ecosystems, broadly defined. Seven of these are near-shore (coral reefs, kelp ecosystems, seagrass meadows, rocky and sandy intertidal, saltmarshes, estuaries, and mangroves) and six are in shelf seas and the open ocean (shelf sea benthos, upper ocean plankton, fish and fisheries, cold water corals, ice-influenced ecosystems, and the deep seafloor). Three cross-cutting issues are emphasized: that climate change impacts are not single factors, but interact together and with other human pressures in a multistressor context; that there are fast and slow climate processes in the ocean, with overall temporal uncertainties relating to future societal behavior; and that there can be high spatial heterogeneity in marine ecosystem impacts and vulnerabilities. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GD-HK-MO) also referred as Greater Bay Area (GBA), is a megalopolis, consisting of nine cities and two special administrative regions, i.e., Hong Kong and Macao in South China. GBA has a total population of approximately 71.2 million people representing about 5% of China’s total population with a combined regional GDP at USD 1642 billion in 2018, i.e. about 12% of GDP for the whole mainland China. Hong Kong acting as a window of China, plays a critical role in contributing to the growth of the GDP. Given the enormous scale of this regional economy and increasing collaboration among these GBA cities, it is utmost important to design a novel environmental impact assessment and emission measurements of the cross-border transportation among Hong Kong and various GBA cities with the aim of proposing countermeasures on carbon emissions of vehicles in the transport and logistics sector of the GBA. In the study, two modified gravity models are designed by considering social, economic, and other variables affecting the carbon emission of vehicles travelling within and across cities in the GBA. Further study will be pursued using decomposition analysis based on the modified gravity model to analyse the crucial contributors and determinants of carbon emission among the GBA cities.

Business and Environmental Sustainability looks at the environmental aspect of sustainability for all organisations pursuing competitive advantage. The book provides theoretical foundations from science, economics, policy and strategy, introduces three environmental challenges (climate change, pollution and waste) and looks at how corporate functions can address these. This textbook provides a thorough foundation by introducing readers to the science, reasoning and theory behind environmental sustainability and then delves into how these ideas translate into principles and business models for organisations to use. Next, it covers environmental challenges from climate change, pollution and waste, and then goes on to examine the different corporate functions (from supply chain management to human resources) to illustrate how environmental sustainability is managed and put into practice in organisations. Finally, a set of integrative case studies draws everything together and enables the reader to apply various analytical tools, with the aim of understanding how companies can not only reduce their environmental footprint but can positively contribute to environmental sustainability. Written by an award-winning lecturer, Business and Environmental Sustainability boasts a wealth of pedagogical features, including examples from a range of industries and countries, plus a companion website with slides, quiz questions and instructor material. This will be a valuable text for students of business, management and environmental sustainability and will also be suitable for broader courses on corporate responsibility and sustainability across environmental studies, political science and engineering. © 2021 Sigrun M.

However, the current adoption of green vehicles in the last mile logistics is relatively low despite many actions taken by public authorities to overcome the negative externalities of distributing goods in cities. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on studies investigating the adoption of green vehicles in urban freight transportation, paying specific attention to e-commerce. To shed light on the adoption of green vehicles in city logistics, the paper conducts a systematic review of the empirical literature on the topic. The 159 articles reviewed were classified into the following: (a) Optimization and scheduling (67 papers); (b) policy (55 papers); (c) sustainability (37 papers). Among the 159 articles, a further selection of 17 papers dealing with e-commerce, i.e., studies that highlight the most relevant aspects related to the integration of green vehicles in e-commerce urban logistics, was performed. Our findings indicate that green vehicles are competitive in urban deliveries characterized by frequent stop-and-go movements and low consolidation levels while incentives are still necessary for their adoption. The use of autonomous vehicles results the most promising and challenging solution for last-mile logistics. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Carbon emissions and city development are currently two major areas of interest worldwide. With the continuous development of cities, the problem of carbon emissions has received substantial attention. Analyzing the relationship between carbon emissions and city development is key to building low-carbon cities. This paper selects the revised Zipf's law to explore diverse carbon emission characteristics in different stages of city development and tries to verify the balance of city development and the rationality of key emitting sectors in China, thus filling a gap in this domain. Based on the analysis of different emitting sectors and diverse city categories, several discoveries are made. First, nearly 80% of Chinese cities have reached the ideal state of Zipf's law between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and city development. In general, carbon emissions and city development are basically matched at the present stage. Second, in cities, the carbon emissions of the agricultural and industrial processes sectors are relatively balanced and stable with the city development. In addition, only the traffic sector is in the stage of intensive development. Other sectors (industrial energy, rural household, urban household, services, and indirect emissions) need to be further optimized. Third, CO2 emissions in other type of cities are basically matched with the city development. Industrial cities, megalopolises and metropolises are in the stage of intensive development, while cities of other types (service-oriented cities and small-medium cities) need to be further optimized. Fourth, corresponding measures, such as adjusting energy and industrial structure, optimizing resource allocation, and promoting intensive production, need to be taken to optimize carbon emissions in cities of different types and in different emitting sectors. Our study provides a particular theoretical basis and practical value, for China and other countries in similar situations, to coordinate the matching correlation between city development and carbon emissions in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Degradation of agricultural catchments due to water erosion is a major environmental threat at the global scale, with long-lasting destructive consequences valued at tens of billions of dollars per annum. Eroded soils lead to reduced crop yields and deprived agroecosystem's functioning through, for example, decreased water holding capacity, poor aeration, scarce microbial activity, and loose soil structure. This can result in reduced carbon sequestration, limited nutrient cycling, contamination of water bodies due to eutrophication, low protection from floods and poor attention restoration-consequences that go far beyond the commonly modelled soil loss and deposition budgets. This book demonstrates, using data from the Harod catchment in northern Israel, how cutting-edge geoinformatics, data science methodologies and soil health indicators can be used to measure, predict, and regulate these major environmental hazards. It shows how these approaches are used to quantify-in time and space-the effect of water erosion not only on the soil layer, soil minerals, and soil loss, but also on the wide-range of services that agricultural ecosystems might supply for the benefit and well-being of humans. The algorithms described in this book play a major role in this paradigm shift and they include, for example, extraction of photogrammetric DEMs from drone's data, advanced drainage structure calculations, fuzzy process-based modelling and spatial topographic threshold computations, multicriteria analyses and expert-based systems development using analytic hierarchal processes, innovative data-mining and machine learning tools, autocorrelation and interpolation of soil health, physically-based soil evolution models, spatial decision support systems and many more. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

	abstract = {The fossil fuel industry has filed an increasing number of dormant Commerce Clause lawsuits against coastal states and cities that have rejected proposals for new coal and oil export facilities in their jurisdictions. These lawsuits are creating a wholly new “law of energy exports” that to date has been underexplored in the academic literature, even as it garners frequent newspaper headlines. This Article is the first comprehensive analysis of this evolving body of law. It evaluates the lawsuits and legal arguments surrounding energy exports and situates them in the context of rapid changes in domestic and international energy resource development and use. It then evaluates the implications of this growing body of law more broadly. Resolution of these lawsuits will affect the ability of states and cities to enact policies that affect a broad range of interstate markets for energy-related goods, such as coal, oil, natural gas, and renewable energy. The law of energy exports will also impact legal doctrines that apply to international trade and the power of the executive branch to shape judicial resolution of dormant Foreign Commerce Clause disputes. This Article concludes that with regard to the energy export cases themselves, existing dormant Commerce Clause doctrine supports the authority of state and local governments to reject new fossil fuel export facilities within their jurisdictions if such actions are implemented to protect public health and the environment, and not for economic protectionist reasons. Moreover, the energy export cases could potentially establish a new jurisprudence with a more limited role for the dormant Commerce Clause to act as a barrier to nondiscriminatory state and local policies that affect interstate energy markets. Such a development would place more focus on Congress rather than on the courts or the executive branch, to resolve energy-related disputes between states. Copyright © 2021 Alexandra B.

	abstract = {Wood pallets play a critical role in the movement and storage of goods worldwide. They are an important component in the complex global supply chain and used by almost every industry. It is therefore important to assess the environmental implications of the wood pallet supply chain and identify optimization strategies that can be implemented. In this paper, primary 2018 annual production data collected from U.S. pallet manufacturers were used to develop the first industry-average life-cycle inventory (LCI). A new functional unit was proposed to perform a more refined and accurate environmental life-cycle assessment of the wood pallet supply chain. Using the LCI data developed, a cradle-to-grave industry-average life-cycle impact assessment was performed. This novel approach quantifies environmental impacts of a generic multi-use pallet, including repair and remanufacturing. The total global warming impact was 10.4 kg CO2e per 45.4 t of pallet loads of product delivered using wood pallets. The manufacturing stage contributed the most, about 35%, followed by the raw material supply stage. About 41% of total primary energy consumption was from renewable sources, with most sourced from biomass. Fossil fuels comprised about 52% of the total (225 MJ per functional unit) primary energy consumption. Total environmental impact was significantly affected by two main parameters: reference service life and load-bearing capacity. Pallet repair was also found to be an important component of the wood pallet supply chain, which has a low environmental footprint compared with the overall impact of a pallet and enables mitigation of overall impact by extending the reference service life. At end-of-life, common industry practices demonstrated substantial potential environmental benefits that can minimize overall environmental impact. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

However, there is a lack of academic commentary on how attempts at various decarbonisation methods reported in research articles have developed over the 21st century, particularly in line with the relevant policy and regulatory developments. This paper analyses how the shipping industry has decarbonised by utilising 294 papers from 2000 to 2020. By analysing 20 years’ worth of research, this paper delivers a comprehensive review of shipping decarbonisation research and analyses the evolution of its themes as a function of time. It therefore aids to develop a greater understanding and comparison of governmental, economic and academic perspectives (and their potential alignment) for the industry to decarbonise. For 2017–20 the key shipping decarbonisation technologies were summarised and their advantages, disadvantages and current academic literature applications are revealed. Furthermore, the analysis of the evolution of shipping decarbonisation research themes reveals clear research gaps in the current literature and guides the development of a future research agenda with the prediction of future opportunities and potential for shipping decarbonisation research developments for the shipping industry. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This chapter presents a new topic that has not been included in previous Handbook chapters, aiming to provide a broad review of the research related to food systems and food networks to guide and motivate agricultural and applied economists new to this space in conducting research on these topics. Many of our examples come from local and regional food systems and food networks as they are both of wide interest globally, and because they represent a growing volume of expertise among researchers. It would be a daunting task attempting to include all literature in this domain given the complexity of research subjects by agricultural and applied economists and scholars from other fields. However, the frameworks and approaches we discuss can be applied to food systems and food networks at a variety of scales and in a variety of contexts. Unsurprisingly, definitions of food systems and food networks are not fully agreed upon by scholars. In this chapter, we begin with discussing various definitions of food systems and food networks; the types of research questions one might want to answer related to food systems and food networks; and the theories, frameworks, data, and methods used to study and answer these questions. This chapter provides examples of the interdisciplinary nature of this work including: (1) examinations of components of food systems versus food networks, (2) characteristics and interactions of actors in building and maintaining food systems and food networks, and (3) integrated systematic approaches to understanding and enhancing food systems and food networks to address societal problems. Our chapter concludes with a discussion of the opportunities and challenges we see for agricultural and applied economists in this field moving forward. Through this work, we hope to stimulate innovative approaches among agricultural and applied economists, working with other disciplines, to explore and analyze relationships, influences, and impacts of food systems and food networks to enhance social, economic, and environmental sustainability and equity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

We discuss how these insights can promote affective reactivity toward sustainability issues, help leverage the potential of emotion to motivate action, and improve emotional climate change communication and intervention strategies. We outline a research agenda that we see as crucial for obtaining a solid evidence base on how emotions can optimally promote sustainable behavior.

Pandemics such as COVID-19 (and comparable disruptions) have caused intense debates over the future of cities. Through a series of investigative studies, Designing Smart and Resilient Cities for a Post-Pandemic World: Metropandemic Revolution seeks to critically discuss and compare different cases, innovations and approaches as to how cities can utilise nascent and future digital technology and/or new strategies in order to build stronger resilience to better tackle comparable large-scale pandemics and/or disruptions in the future. The authors identify ten separate societal areas where future digital technology can impact resilience. These are discussed in individual chapters. Each chapter concludes with a set of proposed "action points" based on the conclusions of each respective study. These serve as solid policy recommendations of what courses of action to take, to help increase the resilience in smart cities for each designated area. Securing resilience and cohesion between each area will bring about the metropandemic revolution. This book features a foreword by Nobel laureate Peter C. Doherty and an afterword by Professor of Urban Technologies, Carlo Ratti. It provides fresh and unique insights on smart cities and futures studies in a pandemic context, offers profound reflections on contemporary societal functions and the needs to build resilience and combines lessons learned from historical pandemics with possibilities offered by future technology. © 2023 Anthony Larsson and Andreas Hatzigeorgiou.},

The residential and commercial sectors produce approximately one third of all carbon emissions in Taiwan, and the number of construction renovation projects is much larger than that of new construction projects. In this paper, we considered the life-cycle CO2 (LCCO2 ) of a building envelope renovation project in Tainan and focused on local construction methods for typical row houses. The LCCO2 of 744 cases with various climate zones, orientations, and insulation and glazing types was calculated via EnergyPlus, SimaPro, and a local database (LCBA database), and the results were then used to develop a machine learning model. Our findings showed that the machine learning model was capable of predicting annual energy consumption and LCCO2 . With regard to annual energy consumption, the RMSE was 227.09 kW·h (per year) and the R2 was 0.992. For LCCO2, the RMSE was 2792.47 kgCO2 eq and the R2 was 0.989, which indicates a high-confidence process for decision making in the early stages of building design and renovation. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Consumption of raw materials, energy, manufactured goods, and services is increasingly concentrated in cities, as urbanization accelerates globally. Such consumption is influenced by complex interactions arising between the various socio-technical and natural systems that make up cities. To improve understanding of the interlinked factors that can perpetuate—or “lock-in”—unsustainable consumption, we build an explanatory framework that conceptually joins the literature on socio-technical systems and on urban consumption. Two questions guide our study: (1) What are the principal socio-technical systems in cities that influence consumption behavior? (2) How do these systems interact to lock urban dwellers into unsustainable consumption behavior? The resulting framework incorporates theories of socio-technical lock-in with factors relating to both “structure” and “agency” in consumption literature. Specifically, it describes the influence and interactions of physical, non-physical, and human systems on two interlinked scales: macro-scale (structure and collectively shared conditions) and micro-scale (agency and individually shaped conditions). To demonstrate the practical value of this framework, we apply it to a case study on mobility in Bangkok, Thailand. This allows us to systematically identify the interlinked mechanisms contributing to the growing dependence on and lock-in to individually owned passenger vehicles. Our study thus provides a comprehensive understanding of the multiplex drivers of consumption behavior, taking into account both structure and agency. The framework also provides a tool for other scholars to empirically identify lock-in mechanisms that hamper the adoption of more sustainable consumption behavior in other sectors and geographies.

This paper offers a micro-simulation of the adoption of compressed natural gas in heavy-duty vehicles based on real French data on industrial flows in 2018 from the automotive manufacturer Renault. Our purpose is to assess the potential of natural gas as a transition fuel for the supply chain by determining the economic conditions under which natural gas is both economically and environmentally beneficial. We consider two types of natural gas: bio-sourced and fossil. Both types of gas trucks prove cost-effective for long-distance flows within a short 5-year time period. However, fossil-fuel natural gas trucks emit from 3 up to 13% more CO2eq than diesel trucks on the same trip, due to the extra kilometres required to reach refuelling stations (+6.21% of distance covered on average). Conversely, compared to diesel trucks, bio-sourced gas reduces the carbon footprint of transportation up to −76%. Thus, only bio-sourced gas proves to be favourable. We also investigate other types of externalities, such as air pollution and noise. We finally find that carbon taxes should be based on life-cycle emissions in order to boost wider adoption of biogas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Investment in extractive or ‘non-fed’ aquaculture has been proposed as a partial solution for sustainable food provision. An important aspect is the potential for aquaculture-environment interactions to influence the provision of ecosystem services. Here, we quantify and monetise the impacts of bivalve and seaweed farming on a regulating service (removal of nitrogen from nearshore waters) and a supporting service (habitat provision for species with fisheries value). We estimate that on average, 275–581 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (in harvest units: 4–25 kg N t -1) is removed via bioextraction at oyster, mussel and seaweed farms, with much smaller contributions from enhanced sediment denitrification beneath farms compared to reference sites. Based on nitrogen offset values in the United States and Europe, this additional nitrogen removal could be worth 84–505 USD t−1 in locations where nutrients are a management priority. Additionally, the habitat structure offered by aquaculture is estimated to support 348–1110 kg ha−1 yr−1 of additional fish compared to reference habitats, potentially worth an additional 972–2504 USD ha−1 yr−1 to commercial fishers or 1087–2848 USD ha−1 yr−1 to recreational fishers. Habitat values assume equal mortality rates at farms and comparable natural habitats, although the direction of effect is robust to small increases in mortality at farms. New policy perspectives may improve the capacity of non-fed aquaculture to sustainably meet the increasing demand for food while enhancing the provision of these two ecosystem services. Responsible development will be crucial to ensure that ecological benefits are not eroded by suboptimal site selection or farming practices that diminish the same or other ecosystem services. © 2021 The Authors},

Why, in an era when climate change is front of mind for so many people, have we failed to make progress? This question has been the source of heated debate across the political spectrum. In Picking Up the Slack, Andrew Green draws together different perspectives on the challenge facing Canada to offer an accessible account of the ideas and institutions that have impeded climate change action. Picking Up the Slack embraces the complexity of the problem, showing that its sources lie deep in Canada’s institutional arrangements - pointing to the role played by federal-provincial power sharing arrangements, the heavy reliance on discretion in Canadian law, the role of the courts, and the impact of social norms. Working from a broad perspective that incorporates the insights of economics, law, political science, and philosophy, Green unpacks the features of Canadian policy making that determine the successes and failures of climate policies. His message is ultimately optimistic: Picking Up the Slack sheds light on how we can bring about meaningful movement towards a fair and positive future. © University of Toronto Press 2022.},

	abstract = {The potential for mitigating climate change is growing worldwide, with an increasing emphasis on reducing CO2 emissions and minimising the impact on the environment. African continent is faced with the unique challenge of climate change whilst coping with extreme poverty, explosive population growth and economic difficulties. CO2 emission patterns in Africa are analysed in this study to understand primary CO2 sources and underlying driving forces further. Data are examined using gravity model, logarithmic mean divisia index and Tapio's decoupling indicator of CO2 emissions from economic development in 20 selected African countries during 1984−2014. Results reveal that CO2 emissions increased by 2.11% (453.73 million ton) over the research period. Gravity centre for African CO2 emissions had shifted towards the northeast direction. Population and economic growth were primary driving forces of CO2 emissions. Industrial structure and emission efficiency effects partially offset the growth of CO2 emissions. The economic growth effect was an offset factor in central African countries and Zimbabwe due to political instability and economic mismanagement. Industrial structure and emission efficiency were insufficient to decouple economic development from CO2 emissions and relieve the pressure of population explosion on CO2 emissions in Africa. Thus, future efforts in reducing CO2 emissions should focus on scale-up energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy update, emission pricing and long-term green development towards sustainable development goals by 2030. © 2020},

The country is also an important global supplier of coal, petroleum and natural gas while per capita fossil energy consumption is relatively low. For biomass- and fossil fuel-based energy, Indonesia has been transforming its energy landscape in order to provide for foreign demand. The landscape - both in literal and in the figurative sense - simultaneously forms and is formed by the material resource flows required for society's biophysical reproduction, i.e. the social metabolism; in the context of the ongoing energy transition, both are subject to change. In our analysis of Indonesia's palm oil production, we find that the drivers shaping the country's resource use as well as its energy landscape are located at a spatial, temporal, and functional distance from where they take effect. The energy landscape and resource use patterns are formed across levels of scale, from the subnational to the global. Energy policy confined to the framework of the sovereign nation-state cannot effectively address the complex drivers of increasingly detrimental environmental change associated with energy transitions nor can it trigger a sustainability transition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There is a growing recognition that a transition to a sustainable low-carbon society is urgently needed. This transition takes place at multiple and complementary scales, including bottom-up approaches such as community-based initiatives (CBIs). However, empirical research on CBIs has focused until now on anecdotal evidence and little work has been done to quantitatively assess their impact in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this paper, we analyze 38 European initiatives across the food, energy, transport, and waste sectors to address the following questions: How can the GHG reduction potential of CBIs be quantified and analyzed in a systematic manner across different sectors? What is the GHG mitigation potential of CBIs and how does the reduction potential differ across domains? Through the comparison of the emission intensity arising from the goods and services the CBIs provide in relation to a business-as-usual scenario, we present the potential they have across different activities. This constitutes the foundational step to upscaling and further understanding their potential contribution to achieving climate change mitigation targets. Our findings indicate that energy generation through renewable sources, changes in personal transportation, and dietary change present by far the highest GHG mitigation activities analyzed, since they reduce the carbon footprint of CBI beneficiaries by 24%, 11%, and 7%, respectively. In contrast, the potential for some activities, such as locally grown organic food, is limited. The service provided by these initiatives only reduces the carbon footprint by 0.1%. Overall, although the proliferation of CBIs is very desirable from a climate change mitigation perspective it is necessary to stress that bottom-up initiatives present other important positive dimensions besides GHG mitigation. These initiatives also hold the potential of improving community resilience by strengthening local economies and enhancing social cohesion. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Since humans began to exploit natural resources for their own economic ends, we have ignored a central principle: nature and humans are not separate, but are a unified, interconnected system in which neither is superior to the other. Policy must reflect this reality. We failed to follow this principle in exploiting natural capital without expecting to pay any price, and in hurriedly adopting environmental laws and policies that reflected how we wanted nature to work instead of how it does work. This study relies on more accurate models for how nature works and humans behave. These models suggest that environmental laws should be consistent with the laws of nature. © Jan Laitos 2017.},

	abstract = {Sustainability in Transition: Principles for Developing Solutionsuoffers the first in-depth education-focused treatment of how to address sustainability in a comprehensive manner. The textbook is structured as a learning-centered approach to walk students through the process of linking sustainable behavior and decision-making to green innovation systems and triple-bottom-line economic development practices, in order to achieve sustainable change in incremental to transformational ways. All chapters combine theory and practice with the help of global case study and research study examples to illustrate barriers and best practices. Each chapter begins with learning objectives and ends with a 'check on learning' section that ties the main points back to the core themes of the book. Chapters include a section focused on measuring progress and a box comparing international research or case studies to the North American focus of the chapter. A list of additional academic sources for students that complement each chapter is included. Building sustainability tools, techniques, and competencies cumulatively with the help of problemand project-based learning modules, Sustainability in Transition: Principles for Developing Solutions is a comprehensive resource for learning sustainability theory and doing sustainability practice. It will be essential reading for advanced undergraduate and graduate level students who have already completed introductory sustainability classes. © 2018 Travis Gliedt and Kelli Larson.},

Projecting the drivers (e.g., technical, economic, societal, regulatory) that will impact future emissions is challenging, and assessing regional air quality (AQ) is complicated by the need for detailed modeling tools and data inputs to simulate chemistry and transport of pollutants. This work assesses the contribution of emissions from transportation sources to ground-level concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter via two methods. First, impacts are quantified for three U.S. regions including California using output from an economic optimization model to grow a base year emissions inventory to 2055. Second, impacts are considered for California using state-level projections with an updated emissions inventory and modeling suite in 2035. For both, advanced AQ models are used, showing that the impacts of light duty vehicles are moderate, reflecting shifts to more efficient and lower emitting technologies. In contrast, heavy duty vehicles, ships, and off-road equipment are associated with important ozone and PM2.5 burdens. Emissions from petroleum fuel production and distribution activities also have notable impacts on ozone and PM2.5. These transportation sub-sectors should be the focus of future emissions reduction policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change and food security are two of humanity’s greatest challenges and are highly interlinked. On the one hand, climate change puts pressure on food security. On the other hand, farming significantly contributes to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This calls for climate-smart agriculture—agriculture that helps to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Climate-smart agriculture measures are diverse and include emission reductions, sink enhancements, and fossil fuel offsets for mitigation. Adaptation measures include technological advancements, adaptive farming practices, and financial management. Here, we review the potentials and trade-offs of climate-smart agricultural measures by producers and consumers. Our two main findings are as follows: (1) The benefits of measures are often site-dependent and differ according to agricultural practices (e.g., fertilizer use), environmental conditions (e.g., carbon sequestration potential), or the production and consumption of specific products (e.g., rice and meat). (2) Climate-smart agricultural measures on the supply side are likely to be insufficient or ineffective if not accompanied by changes in consumer behavior, as climate-smart agriculture will affect the supply of agricultural commodities and require changes on the demand side in response. Such linkages between demand and supply require simultaneous policy and market incentives. It, therefore, requires interdisciplinary cooperation to meet the twin challenge of climate change and food security. The link to consumer behavior is often neglected in research but regarded as an essential component of climate-smart agriculture. We argue for not solely focusing research and implementation on one-sided measures but designing good, site-specific combinations of both demand- and supply-side measures to use the potential of agriculture more effectively to mitigate and adapt to climate change. © 2017, The Author(s).},

Remedies that are acceptable for the great majority tend to make things worse. We seem to be in a philosophical crisis. Pope Francis says it clearly: our common home is in deadly danger. Analyzing the philosophical crisis, the book comes to the conclusion that the world may need a “new enlightenment”; one that is not based solely on doctrine, but instead addresses a balance between humans and nature, as well as a balance between markets and the state, and the short versus long term. To do this we need to leave behind working in ”silos” in favor of a more systemic approach that will require us to rethink the organization of science and education. However, we have to act now; the world cannot wait until 7.6 billion people have struggled to reach a new enlightenment. This book is full of optimistic case studies and policy proposals that will lead us back to a trajectory of sustainability. But it is also necessary to address the taboo topic of population increase. Countries with a stable population fare immensely better than those with continued increase. Finally, we are presenting an optimistic book from the Club of Rome. © Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2018.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is one of the most impactful ways that we interact with the environment. Food demand is expected to increase 70% by 2050 as a result of population growth and the emergence of the global middle class. Meeting the expected demand in a sustainable manner will require an integrated systems-level approach to food production and supply. We present a conceptual framework for estimating the cradle-to-market life-cycle seasonal greenhouse gas emissions impact of fresh produce commodities, including the production, post-harvest processing, packaging, and transportation stages. Using oranges as a case study, we estimate the carbon footprint per kilogram of fruit delivered to wholesale market in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Atlanta and assess the relative importance of transportation mode, transportation distance (i.e. localness), and seasonality. We find that the cradle-to-market carbon footprint of oranges delivered to US cities can vary by more than a factor of two, depending on the production origin (e.g. 0.3 kgCO2e/kg for Californian oranges delivered to New York City versus 0.7 kgCO2e/kg for Mexican oranges delivered to New York City). The transportation mode was found to have a significant impact on the results; transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions associated with oranges trucked from Mexico to New York City were found to be six times higher than those transported by containership from Chile, in spite of traveling less than half the distance. Seasonality had a moderate impact on the results and varied depending on the destination city; based on our cradle-to-market analysis, the average carbon footprint of 'out-of-season' oranges relative to 'in-season' oranges increased by 51%, 46%, 14%, and 24% for Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City, respectively. This study highlights the value of regionally-specific carbon footprinting for fresh produce and the need for a consistent and standardized data reporting framework for agricultural systems. © 2020 The Author(s).

As the need to respond to the causes and impacts of climate change becomes increasingly urgent, emissions calculations and inventories are a vital first step towards mastering climatic risk. The Handbook of Carbon Accounting offers an accessible and comprehensive presentation of the discipline. The book examines the different methods or instruments implemented by countries and companies - such as carbon taxation, carbon markets and voluntary offsetting - while revealing how these stem not simply from the aim of reducing emissions for the lowest cost, but more as a compromise between divergent interests and individual world views. It also explores the historical context of the emergence of carbon accounting, assessing its evolution since the Rio Conference in 1992 and the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, to the latest Conference of Parties in 2015 in Paris.The book concludes with a very practical guide to calculate, reduce, offset and disclose your carbon footprint.Like other management tools, carbon accounting may not be an exact science, but its contribution has never been more important. The Handbook of Carbon Accounting is a vital educational resource that will help readers - including those with no prior knowledge of the field - to understand carbon flows and stocks and to take action.

The evidence of diet’s impact on public health and the environment has grown in recent decades, yet changing food supply, consumer habits and economic aspirations proves hard. This book explores what is meant by sustainable diets and why this has to be the goal for the Anthropocene, the current era in which human activities are driving the mismatch of humans and the planet. Food production and consumption are key drivers of transitions already underway, yet policy makers hesitate to reshape public eating habits and tackle the unsustainability of the global food system. The authors propose a multi-criteria approach to sustainable diets, giving equal weight to nutrition and public health, the environment, socio-cultural issues, food quality, economics and governance. This six-pronged approach to sustainable diets brings order and rationality to what either is seen as too complex to handle or is addressed simplistically and ineffectually. The book provides a major overview of this vibrant issue of interdisciplinary and public interest. It outlines the reasons for concern and how actors throughout the food system (governments, producers, civil society and consumers) must engage with (un)sustainable diets. © 2017 Pamela Mason and Tim Lang.},

Through closely argued explorations of the development paradigm, issues of social justice, democratic practice, migration and climate change, Mobilizing Heritage illuminates the many shifts that currently animate heritage theory and practice."-Emma Waterton, coeditor of Heritage, Affect and Emotion: Politics, Practices and Infrastructures Mapping out emerging areas for global cultural heritage, this book provides an anthropological perspective on the growing field of heritage studies. Kathryn Lafrenz Samuels adopts a dual focus-looking back on the anthropological foundations for cultural heritage research while looking forward to areas of practice that reach beyond national borders: economic development, climate action, democratic practice, heritage rights, and global justice. Taken together, these areas characterize transnational heritage activity and represent channels for working around, negotiating, and pushing back against the traditional authority of nation-states and intergovernmental treaty-based organizations such as UNESCO. Lafrenz Samuels argues that transnational heritage involves an important shift from a paradigm of preservation to a paradigm of development. Responding to this expanding developmental sensibility, she positions cultural heritage as a persuasive tool for transformative action, capable of mobilizing and shaping social change. Using examples drawn from her research and fieldwork in North Africa, the Arctic, and the United States, she shows how anthropological approaches foster and support the persuasive power of heritage in the transnational sphere. © 2018 by Kathryn Lafrenz Samuels.

As urban populations grow, how do we create efficient transportation systems, access to healthy green space, and lower-carbon buildings for all citizens? Peter Newman, Timothy Beatley, and Heather Boyer respond to these questions in the revised and updated edition of Resilient Cities. Since the first edition was published in 2009, interest in resilience has surged, in part due to increasingly frequent and deadly natural disasters, and in part due to the contribution of our cities to climate change. The number of new initiatives and approaches from citizens and all levels of government show the promise as well as the challenges of creating cities that are truly resilient. The authors’ hopeful approach to creating cities that are not only resilient, but striving to become regenerative, is now organized around their characteristics of a resilient city. A resilient city is one that uses renewable and distributed energy; has an efficient and regenerative metabolism; offers inclusive and healthy places; fosters biophilic and naturally adaptive systems; is invested in disaster preparedness; and is designed around efficient urban fabrics that allow for sustainable mobility. Resilient Cities, Second Edition reveals how the resilient city characteristics have been achieved in communities around the globe. The authors offer stories, insights, and inspiration for urban planners, policymakers, and professionals interested in creating more sustainable, equitable, and, eventually, regenerative cities. Most importantly, the book is about overcoming fear and generating hope in our cities. Cities will need to claim a different future that helps us regenerate the whole planet-this is the challenge of resilient cities. © 2017 Peter Newman, Timothy Beatley, and Heather Boyer.

	abstract = {This book offers a comprehensive global examination of the relationship between public transport and tourism as well as exploring other sustainable transport modes. It offers a unique view by analysing tourism through the public transport lens and vice versa. The volume provides an account of how the public transport experience can be improved for tourists so that its value can be maximised and a greater number of people can be encouraged to shift modes. It features a wide range of case studies and examples showing how the tourism industry, as well as regional economies, communities and the environment, benefit when public transport is widely used by tourists. The book will be of interest to researchers and students in the fields of tourism and transport as well as destination marketing organisations and tourism, transport and urban planners. © 2017 C.

	abstract = {The transportation of aggregates from quarry to production site raises significant concerns over carbon emissions. A considerable body of literature argues that if more freight could be carried on the rail network, substantial reductions in carbon footprints could be made. This paper describes a modelling framework for estimating the spatial transfer or movement of aggregates between quarries in England and Wales and local authority districts (demand zones). A key part of this framework is the estimation of the carbon emissions associated with both road and rail travel. Once built and calibrated, the model is used for a variety of what-if scenarios relating to the increased use of rail (which includes the necessary construction of new uplifting facilities as well as the number of rail-linked quarries) against future road haulage undertaken through a modernised vehicle fleet. The latter is shown to provide a more realistic and economic solution to reducing carbon emissions associated with the transportation of aggregates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Shipping carries virtually all internationally traded goods. Major commercial ports are fully integrated into transnational production and distribution systems, enabling the circulation of massive flows of energy and materials in the global economy. Port activity and development are usually associated with positive socio-economic effects, such as increased GDP and employment, but the industry’s continuous expansion produces adverse outcomes including air and water pollution, the destruction of marine and coastal environments, waterfront congestion, health risks, and labor issues. In its quest to marry economic growth and environmental sustainability in the maritime industries, proponents of the newly coined blue growth paradigm assume the negative impacts of ports and shipping to be fixable mostly through technological innovation. This paper questions the validity of the premise that the unlimited growth of the port and shipping industries is compatible with environmental sustainability and analyses the feasibility of technological improvements to offset the sector’s associated negative impacts. Based on insights from ecological economics and political ecology, ports can be described as power-laden assemblages of spaces, flows, and actors, which produce unequally distributed socio-ecological benefits and burdens at multiple scales. Focusing on the case of the Port of Barcelona, this study argues that the continuous expansion of port activity increases seldom accounted-for negative socio-environmental impacts, acquiring an uneconomic character for port cities and regions. In contrast, de-growth is presented as a radical sustainability alternative to ocean-based growth paradigms. The paper concludes by discussing its prospective ‘blue’ articulation in the context of maritime transportation while offering some avenues for future research and policymaking. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

Even when such decisions claim to be guided by objective knowledge, they are made and implemented through political institutions and relationships-and all the competing interests and power struggles that this implies. Michael Méndez tells a timely story of people, place, and power in the context of climate change and inequality. He explores the perspectives and influence low-income people of color bring to their advocacy work on climate change. In California, activist groups have galvanized behind issues such as air pollution, poverty alleviation, and green jobs to advance equitable climate solutions at the local, state, and global levels. Arguing that environmental protection and improving public health are inextricably linked, Mendez contends that we must incorporate local knowledge, culture, and history into policymaking to fully address the global complexities of climate change and the real threats facing our local communities. © 2020 by Michael Méndez.},

Humans must mitigate the causes of, and adapt to, climate change and the loss of biodiversity, as the impacts of these changes become more apparent and demand urgent responses. These pressures, combined with rapid global urbanisation and population growth mean that new ways of designing, retrofitting and living in cities are critically needed. Incorporating an understanding of how the living world works and what ecosystems do into architectural and urban design is a step towards the creation and evolution of cities that are radically more sustainable and potentially regenerative. Can cities produce their own food, energy, and water? Can they be designed to regulate climate, provide habitat, cycle nutrients, and purify water, air and soil?. This book examines and defines the field of biomimicry for sustainable built environment design and goes on to translate ecological knowledge into practical methodologies for architectural and urban design that can proactively respond to climate change and biodiversity loss. These methods are tested and exemplified through a series of case studies of existing cities in a variety of climates. Regenerative Urban Design and Ecosystem Biomimicry will be of great interest to students, professionals and researchers of architecture, urban design, ecology, and environmental studies, as well as those interested in the interdisciplinary study of sustainability, ecology and urbanism. © 2018 Maibritt Pedersen Zari.

This study collected 3698 papers related to CF from the Web of Science database as research samples (year 2007 to 2018). Based on CiteSpace, the knowledge base, popular topics, and research trends of CF are presented. The results show the following: (1) from 2007 to 2018, the number of articles on CF have steadily increased. (2) After spatial analysis of the literature, we found that among research institutions, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has the largest number of publications on the issue. When it comes to country, three important research forces can be identified: USA, China, and UK. (3) Research on the CF is interdisciplinary; in addition to the traditional fields of environmental, political, economics, and computing, CF research has received attention from the Physics, Materials, Chemistry, Mathematics, and animal sciences. (4) Through keyword clustering, currently popular topics in research can be roughly divided into four aspects: CF calculation methods, research scales, energy, and agriculture. (5) The CF research during the study period is divided into four stages according to the burst time and content of the burst keywords. According to the research status and trend, this paper puts forward the future research direction of carbon footprint. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

This work suggests humanity has been unsustainable in all three areas for most of its history, although in the last few hundred years the scale of unsustainability has increased, while, simultaneously, answers have started to emerge. This conclusion can be seen in two parts, namely the economic and social sides of sustainable development and then the environmental ones. This work suggests that, with the correct selection of tools, solid and positive foundations for the economic and social sides of sustainable development is possible as the world globalizes. This is not, however, a foregone conclusion. Despite a number of recent positive indicators in this area, there are still very large unanswered questions with existing mechanisms and other gaps in the international architecture which, if not fixed, could quickly make problems of economic and social sustainability worse, not better. With the third leg of sustainable development, that for the environment, the optimism is not as strong. The good news is that science, laws, and policies have evolved and expanded to the level that, in theory, there is no environmental problem which cannot be solved. In many areas, especially in the developed world, success is already easy to measure. Where it is not easy to measure, and pessimism creeps in, is in the developing world, which is now inheriting a scale and mixture of environmental difficulties which are simply unprecedented. © A Gillespie 2017.},

It is defined as a process or system where yields are increased without adverse environmental impact and without the cultivation of more land. Co-written by Jules Pretty, one of the pioneers of the concept and internationally known and respected authority on sustainable agriculture, this book sets out current thinking and debates around sustainable agriculture and intensification. It recognises that world population is increasing rapidly, so that yields must increase on finite land and other resources to maintain food security. It provides the first widely accessible overview of the concept of SI as an innovative approach to agriculture and as a key element in the transition to a green economy. It presents evidence from around the world to show how various innovations are improving yields, resilience and farm incomes, particularly for ‘resource constrained’ smallholders in developing countries, but also in the developed world. It shows how SI is a fundamental departure from previous models of agricultural intensification. It also highlights the particular role and potential of small-scale farmers and the fundamental importance of social and human capital in designing and spreading effective innovations. © 2018 Jules Pretty and Zareen Pervez Bharucha.},

The authors present a deep analysis of the ways that industrial states - both developed and developing - are currently unsustainable and how economic and social welfare are related to the environment, to public health and safety, and to earning capacity and meaningful and rewarding employment. The authors offer multipurpose solutions to the sustainability challenge that integrate industrial development, employment, technology, environment, national and international law, trade, finance, and public and worker health and safety. The authors present a compelling wake-up call that warns of the collision course set between the current paths of continued growth and inevitable unsustainability in the world today. Offering clear examples and real solutions, this textbook illustrates how the driving forces that are currently promoting unsustainability can be refocused and redesigned to reverse course and improve the state of the world.

Human life relies upon two systems: the biosphere and the system that produces our goods and services. Today, these two systems are in conflict, and we all face the question of whether we can stop damaging our environment while still supplying the essential goods and services we have come to depend on. Ecological Living presents an optimistic vision of our future by showing how decoupling the productive system from resource extraction is possible, and how this is a key means of achieving an equitable world within environmental limits. For long-term sustainability, the book argues that we must become more efficient in the use of our resources so that resource extraction, and the accompanying environmental costs, can be reduced. Demonstrating the essential steps towards a just and sustainable world, Ecological Living will be of great interest to all students, academics, and policymakers working in the field of environment and sustainability. © 2019 John Gusdorf.},

The evidence ranges from chemical signals arising from pollution, to landscape changes associated with urbanisation, and biological changes associated with species invasion and extinctions. Global environmental change is placed within the context of planetary processes and deep geological time, allowing the reader to appreciate the scale of human-driven change and compare the global transition taking place today with major transitions in Earth history.

	abstract = {We assessed freshwater consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and air emissions of using compressed and liquefied natural gas (NG) as transportation fuels by three heavy-duty NG vehicles (NGV) types from a wells-to-wheels (WTW) perspective. We analyzed freshwater consumption for NG production in major U.S. shale gas plays from recent reports and studies. We reviewed recent literature quantifying methane leakage from the NG supply chain and vehicle use to improve the estimates of NGV GHG emissions. Results show that NGVs could reduce freshwater consumption significantly and offer air emissions reduction benefits compared to their diesel counterparts. NGV WTW GHG emissions are largely driven by the vehicle fuel efficiency, as well as methane leakage rates of both the NG supply chain and vehicle end use: we estimate WTW GHG emissions of NGVs to be slightly higher than those of the diesel counterparts given the estimated WTW methane leakage. NGVs utilizing the newest aftertreatment systems have lower WTW and vehicle operation NOx emissions across different duty-cycles and slightly lower WTW PM emissions than their diesel counterparts. We found that the cost-effectiveness of NGVs is impacted by incremental cost of NG storage tanks and the price difference between NG and diesel fuels. These findings for NGVs shed light on their environmental and economic impacts from a WTW holistic point of view. © 2017},

	abstract = {The Autonomous Vehicle (AV) has been strongly heralded as the most exciting innovation in automobility for decades. Autonomous Vehicles are no longer an innovation of the future (seen only in science fiction) but are now being road-tested for use. And yet while the technical and economic success and possibilities of the AV have been widely debated, there has been a notable lack of discussion around the social, behavioural, and environmental implications. This book is the first to address these issues and to deeply consider the environmental and social sustainability outlook for the AV and how it will impact on communities. Environmental and social sustainability are goals unlike those of technical development (a new tool) and economic development (a new investment). The goal of sustainability is development of societies that live well and equitably within their ecological limits. Is it reasonable and desirable that only technical and economic success comprise the swelling AV parade, or should we be looking at the wider impacts on personal well-being, wider society, and the environment? The uptake for AVs looks to be lengthy, disjointed, and episodic, in large measure because it faces a range of known unknown risks. This book assesses the environmental and social sustainability potential for AVs based on their prospective energy use and their impacts on climate change, urban landscapes, public health, mobility inequalities, and individual and social well-being. It examines public attitudes about AV use and its risk of fostering a rebound effect that compromises potential sustainability gains. The book concludes with a discussion of critical issues involved in sustainable AV diffusion. © 2020 George Martin.},

	abstract = {Loss of biodiversity is one of the great environmental challenges facing humanity but unfortunately efforts to reduce the rate of loss have so far failed. At the same time, these efforts have too often resulted in unjust social outcomes in which people living in or near to areas designated for conservation lose access to their territories and resources. In this book the author argues that our approach to biodiversity conservation needs to be more strongly informed by a concern for and understanding of social justice issues. Injustice can be a driver of biodiversity loss and a barrier to efforts at preservation. Conversely, the pursuit of social justice can be a strong motivation to find solutions to environmental problems. The book therefore argues that the pursuit of socially just conservation is not only intrinsically the right thing to do, but will also be instrumental in bringing about greater success. The argument for a more socially just conservation is initially developed conceptually, drawing upon ideas of environmental justice that incorporate concerns for distribution, procedure and recognition. It is then applied to a range of approaches to conservation including benefit sharing arrangements, integrated conservation and development projects and market-based approaches such as sustainable timber certification and payments for ecosystem services schemes. Case studies are drawn from the author’s research in Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Laos, Bolivia, China and India. © 2017 Adrian Martin.},

	abstract = {In view of the increasing depletion of fossil fuel resources, the concept "bioeconomy" aims at the gradual replacement of fossil fuels by renewable feedstock. Seen as a comprehensive societal transition, the bioeconomy is a complex field that includes a variety of sectors, actors, and interests and is related to far-reaching changes in today's production systems. While the objectives pursued-such as reducing dependence on fossil fuels, mitigating climate change, ensuring global food security, and increasing the industrial use of biogenic resources-are not generally contentious, there is fierce controversy over the possible pathways for achieving these objectives. Based on a thorough literature review, the article identifies major lines of conflict in the current discourse. Criticism of the prevalent concept refers mainly to the strong focus on technology, the lack of consideration given to alternative implementation pathways, the insufficient differentiation of underlying sustainability requirements, and the inadequate participation of societal stakeholders. Since today it cannot be predicted which pathway will be the most expedient-the one already being taken or one of the others proposed-this paper suggests pursuing a strategy of diversity concerning the approaches to shape the bioeconomy, the funding of research topics, and the involvement of stakeholders. © 2016 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this book, Steffen Lange and Tilman Santarius investigate how digitalization influences environmental and social sustainability. The information revolution is currently changing the daily lives of billions of people worldwide. At the same time, the current economic model and consumerist lifestyle needs to be radically transformed if society is to overcome the challenges humanity is facing on a finite planet. Can the much-discussed disruption potential of digitalization be harnessed for this purpose? Smart Green World? provides guiding principles for a sustainable digital society and develops numerous hands-on proposals for how digitalization can be shaped to become a driving force for social transformation. For instance, the authors explain why more digitalization is needed to realize the transition towards 100% renewable energy and show how this can be achieved without sacrificing privacy. They analyze how the information revolution can transform consumption patterns, mobility habits and industry structures – instead of fostering the consumption of unneeded stuff due to personalized commercials and the acceleration of life. The authors reveal how Artificial Intelligence and the Industrial Internet of Things pose novel environmental challenges and contribute to a polarization of income; but they also demonstrate how the internet can be restored to its status as a commons, with users taking priority and society at large reaping the benefits of technological change in a most democratic way. Providing a comprehensive and practical assessment of both social and environmental opportunities and challenges of digitalization, Smart Green World? Making Digitalization Work for Sustainability will be of great interest to all those studying the complex interrelationship of the twenty-first-century megatrends of digitalization and decarbonization. © 2020 Steffen Lange and Tilman Santarius.},

	abstract = {As agriculture is an important contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, carbon labelling aiming at climate protection will play an increasing role in the future. An important example is the development of guidelines and standards for climate-neutral agricultural products and their respective certification. Carbon neutral certifications are, however, affected by criticism and mistrust as there were cases of doubtful claims to carbon neutrality in the past. Against this background, this paper analyses a rather promising case of certification for carbon neutrality: the pioneer case of the Costa Rican coffee cooperative Coopedota, which is the first organization worldwide that achieved certification for carbon neutrality in coffee using a renowned international standard. Coopedota's carbon neutral coffee is certified according to the Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 2060, which is based on a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The paper analyses how the cooperative came to apply this certification, which challenges it faced and how the cooperative solved them. Furthermore, the paper examines the social, political and institutional factors that fostered this innovation. To analyse the success factors that were relevant in this case, a Social Network Analysis approach was used. An innovative tool called ‘Process Net-Map’ was applied to visualize the social networks that enabled the actors to pursue the certification scheme. Process Net-Map also made it possible to identify the role and importance of different types of actors. The analysis shows that the certification created awareness on emission hot-spots along the coffee value chain. Reliable farm data from producers were identified as crucial because emissions at the farm level account for 60% of total emissions. It was also found that by avoiding pure offsetting, PAS 2060 supports emission reduction; however, PAS 2060 does not account for on-site carbon sequestration, for which coffee cultivation has high potential. Overall, the study found that the most important success factors include a combination of (i) past achievements in Coopedota's sustainability policy, which was incentivised by national and international trends and (ii) strong, visionary actors who performed the necessary network functions. The analysis also showed that the network of relevant actors is highly centralized, (indicated by a degree centrality of 86%), which may jeopardize the sustainability of the innovation project. Moreover, the network analysis revealed the importance of ‘double linkages’ between actors, which points to the role that combined services, such as funding and advice, played for the introduction of the certification scheme. General implications are derived from this case for future efforts to promote carbon neutral certification schemes for agri-food products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Almost half of the total organic carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems is stored in forest soils. By altering rates of input or release of C from soils, forest management activities can influence soil C stocks in forests. In this review, we synthesize current evidence regarding the influences of 13 common forest management practices on forest soil C stocks. Afforestation of former croplands generally increases soil C stocks, whereas on former grasslands and peatlands, soil C stocks are unchanged or even reduced following afforestation. The conversion of primary forests to secondary forests generally reduces soil C stocks, particularly if the land is converted to an agricultural land-use prior to reforestation. Harvesting, particularly clear-cut harvesting, generally results in a reduction in soil C stocks, particularly in the forest floor and upper mineral soil. Removal of residues by harvesting whole-trees and stumps negatively affects soil C stocks. Soil disturbance from site preparation decreases soil C stocks, particularly in the organic top soil, however improved growth of tree seedlings may outweigh soil C losses over a rotation. Nitrogen (N) addition has an overall positive effect on soil C stocks across a wide range of forest ecosystems. Likewise, higher stocks and faster accumulation of soil C occur under tree species with N-fixing associates. Stocks and accumulation rates of soil C also differ under different tree species, with coniferous species accumulating more C in the forest floor and broadleaved species tending to store more C in the mineral soil. There is some evidence that increased tree species diversity could positively affect soil C stocks in temperate and subtropical forests, but tree species identity, particularly N-fixing species, seems to have a stronger impact on soil C stocks than tree species diversity. Management of stand density and thinning have small effects on forest soil C stocks. In forests with high populations of ungulate herbivores, reduction in herbivory levels can increase soil C stocks. Removal of plant biomass for fodder and fuel is related to a reduction in the soil C stocks. Fire management practices such as prescribed burning reduce soil C stocks, but less so than wildfires which are more intense. For each practice, we identify existing gaps in knowledge and suggest research to address the gaps. © 2020},

	abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed an ever growing partisan divide in US politics over climate change and global warming. Significant elements in the Republican Party became openly hostile to the scientific evidence and, following the election of George W. Bush, legislative action at the federal level effectively ground to a halt. This opened up space at the state and local level to develop climate change policies with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco and New York implementing a number of initiatives that brought real and substantive developments. The election of Barack Obama in 2008 seemed to open new possibilities for federal and global leadership once more and whilst the Obama administration has been criticised for a somewhat contradictory approach to the issue at times, there were nonetheless a number of substantive policy developments. Through a substantive and detailed analysis of the politics of climate change, this book places the evolution of US climate policy within broader debates on the nature of politics in the US and argues that there exists a latent potential, often obscured by the complexities of its political system, for America to act as a world leader on the issue. This work will appeal particularly to students and scholars in American Politics, but will also prove useful to those in the fields of general Politics, climate change, sustainability, and environmental studies. © 2018 Hugh Atkinson.

	abstract = {Strong decreases in greenhouse gas emissions are required to meet the reduction trajectory resolved within the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, even these decreases will not avert serious stress and damage to life on Earth, and additional steps are needed to boost the resilience of ecosystems, safeguard their wildlife, and protect their capacity to supply vital goods and services. We discuss how well-managed marine reserves may help marine ecosystems and people adapt to five prominent impacts of climate change: Acidification, sea-level rise, intensification of storms, shifts in species distribution, and decreased productivity and oxygen availability, as well as their cumulative effects. We explore the role of managed ecosystems in mitigating climate change by promoting carbon sequestration and storage and by buffering against uncertainty in management, environmental fluctuations, directional change, and extreme events. We highlight both strengths and limitations and conclude that marine reserves are a viable low-Tech, costeffective adaptation strategy that would yield multiple cobenefits from local to global scales, improving the outlook for the environment and people into the future.},

In this paper, the allocation of export containers to transportation modes, by incorporating social and ecological risks with a main focus on the minimization of transportation costs, was examined. A mixed-integer-programming-based mathematical model was proposed to decide how the containers can be allocated to different transportation modes. In addition, a fuzzy-based approach was performed to determine the social and ecological risk weights of the transportation modes within the decision process. Each mode was evaluated with social risks (e.g., human accidents and deaths) and ecological risks (e.g., emission values and noise pollution) by decision makers via the assignment of numerical scores. The obtained results show that optimal transportation modes more economical and environmentally friendly were provided by the proposed methods. © 2018 by the authors.},

This article explores the impacts of policies associated with various ‘non-energy sectors’ on energy supply and demand, using a systematic and wide-ranging review of academic, policy and grey literatures. We discuss six policy sectors where these impacts are, in our assessment, not sufficiently recognised by policymakers or researchers but have significant energy implications. Overall, we find that there is little acknowledgement or analysis of this issue, especially of the full causal chain from ‘non-energy policies’ through to energy system impacts; for whatever reason, consideration of the reverse links (e.g. of the health impacts of energy policies) is far more common. The upshot is that non-energy policy impacts on energy systems are not sufficiently visible within either research or policy. We argue that this serves as a barrier to change, and that increasing the visibility of these complex and multi-faceted connections is thus a vital task for researchers and policymakers alike. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Survey questions indicated that the characteristics of the cities are consistent with the broader literature on policy adoption for urban sustainability and greenhouse-gas initiatives. For example, a majority of the communities in the sample indicated local concern with air and fossil-fuel pollution and climate-related risk, and they had a liberal (left-leaning) political culture. Policy “entrepreneurs” (initiative leaders) were from environmental organizations and/or the local government, and both often worked with a broad, community-wide coalition. The leading supportive frame other than greenhouse-gas emissions was local job creation, and the leading frame for opposition or skepticism was affordability. Recommendations and political strategy for advocates are discussed, and an analysis of implementation strategy is also provided.

	abstract = {Oceangoing ships carry approximately 80% of the world's traded goods by volume, which translates into more than 10 billion tonnes in shipped traded volumes per year (UNCTAD, 2017). Despite its importance, the maritime shipping sector has been traditionally overlooked in climate mitigation discussions, since this sector was largely neglected in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Key barriers for successful implementation of CO2 abatement measures in the sector include the lack of reliable emissions data and the inherent difficulty of attributing responsibility for international shipping emissions to the involved countries, companies and commodities, as well as the threat to global trade interests. We argue that the data paucity on maritime emissions from international trade can be addressed by linking and integrating a large wealth of data, previously used in isolation. By linking per vessel cargo composition data, individual vessel journeys from the Automatic Identification System and a bottom-up methodology to estimate emissions, using vessel specifications and details on their movements and operations, this paper describes and demonstrates this new approach for the case of Brazil's shipping manifests in 2014. We find that the maritime transportation associated with these trades is responsible for 25.99 million tonnes of CO2, an addition of 5% to Brazil's total CO2 emissions of 2014 (reported by the World Bank, currently excluding international shipping and aviation). We discuss the contribution of all traded commodities, as well as the role of the first destination ports and countries. The voyage- and commodity-specificity of this method allows us to showcase those commodities and trading routes which contribute the most towards this emissions account, in relation to those that are most valuable to Brazil's economy. We go on to discuss the implications of scaling up this methodology for global greenhouse gas abatement efforts and demand-side footprint calculations, as well as to improve accountability mechanisms for the maritime sector as a whole. © 2018 The Authors},

The musteloids are the most speciose and diverse super-family among carnivores, ranging from little known, exotic, and highly-endangered species to the popular and familiar, and include a large number of introduced invasives. They feature terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal, and aquatic members, ranging from tenacious predators to frugivorous omnivores, span weights from a 100g weasel to 30kg giant otters, and express a range of social behaviours from the highly gregarious to the fiercely solitary. Their diversity and extensive biogeography inform a wide spectrum of ecological theory and conservation practice. Beginning with a brief account of 93 musteloid species, there follow eight comprehensive review chapters covering topics most relevant to musteloid biology and conservation: evolution, form and function, population dynamics, communication, social organisation, exploitation and conflict with people, study tools and techniques, and disease. Twenty detailed case studies then delve into the very best species investigations worldwide, written by leading figures in the field, and providing a range of geographic and taxonomic coverage. The final chapter synthesises what has been discussed in the book, and reflects on the different and diverse conservation needs of musteloids and the wealth of conservation lessons they offer. © Oxford University Press 2017.},

	abstract = {The concept of sustainability lies at the core of the challenge of environment and development, and the way governments, business and environmental groups respond to it. Green Development provides a clear and coherent analysis of sustainable development in both theory and practice. Green Development explores the origins and evolution of mainstream thinking about sustainable development and offers a critique of the ideas behind them. It draws a link between theory and practice by discussing the nature of the environmental degradation and the impacts of development. It argues that, ultimately, ‘green’ development has to be about political economy, about the distribution of power, and not about environmental quality. Its focus is strongly on the developing world. The fourth edition retains the broad structure of previous editions, but has been updated to reflect advances in ideas and changes in international policy. Greater attention has been given to the political ecology of development, market-based and neoliberal environmentalism, and degrowth. This fully revised edition discusses: The origins of thinking about sustainability and sustainable development, and its evolution to the present day; the ideas that dominate mainstream sustainable development (including natural capital, the green economy, market environmentalism and ecological modernisation); critiques of mainstream ideas and of neoliberal framings of sustainability, and alternative ideas about sustainability that challenge ‘business as usual’ thinking, such as arguments about limits to growth and calls for degrowth; the dilemmas of sustainability in the context of forests, desertification, food and farming, biodiversity conservation and dam construction; the challenge of policy choices about sustainability, particularly between reformist and radical responses to the contemporary global dilemmas. Green Development offers clear insights into the challenges of environmental sustainability, and social and economic development. It is unique in offering a synthesis of theoretical ideas on sustainability and in its coverage of the extensive literature on environment and development around the world. The book has proved its value to generations of students as an authoritative, thought-provoking and readable guide to the field of sustainable development. © 2020 W.M. Adams.},

The objective of this study was to estimate the GHG emissions associated with the construction and operation of three road cases-two primary roads and one secondary road network-in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The GHG emissions produced by the study cases were estimated using the RoadCO2 estimation tool. Results showed that the total emissions (in kg CO2e/m2/y) range from 76 for the secondary road case to 1100 for the primary road cases. The operation phase is responsible for 94-98% of these emissions; the construction phase is responsible for the rest. Road works contributed the most to GHG emissions during the construction phase. The contribution of the remaining categories of the construction phase fluctuates within a certain case and among the considered cases. The equipment used in the construction phase for the three cases contributed 15-70% of the total phase emissions, while the remaining emissions were due to construction materials. In the operation phase, emissions were mainly generated by vehicle movement. Street lighting also contributed to emissions during the operation phase. On the other hand, the irrigation of planted trees along the road had a very low impact on GHG emissions, and carbon sequestration by these trees had a negligible effect in terms of acting as a carbon sink. The results obtained from this study were compared with other cases reported in the literature. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Heavy-duty on-road vehicles account for 70% of all freight transport and 20% of transportation-sector greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States. This study measured three prevalent GHG emissions – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) – from seven heavy-duty vehicles, fueled by diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG), and compliant to the MY 2007 or 2010 U.S. EPA emission standards, while operated over six routes used for freight movement in California. Total combined (tractor, trailer, and payload) weights were 68,000 ± 1000 lbs. for the seven vehicles. Using the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) radiative forcing values for a 100-year time horizon, N2O emissions accounted for 2.6–8.3% of total tailpipe CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2-eq) for diesel vehicles equipped with Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, Diesel Particulate Filter, and Selective Catalytic Reduction system (DOC + DPF + SCR), and CH4 emissions accounted for 1.4–5.9% of CO2-eq emissions from the CNG-powered vehicle with a three-way catalyst (TWC). N2O emissions from diesel vehicles equipped with SCR (0.17–0.30 g/mi) were an order of magnitude higher than diesel vehicles without SCR (0.013–0.023 g/mi) during highway operation. For the vehicles selected in this test program, we measured 11–22% lower CO2-eq emissions from a hybrid compared to conventional diesel vehicles during transport over lower-speed routes of the freight transport system, but 20–27% higher CO2-eq emissions during higher-speed routes.

	abstract = {Background: The food industry is heavily dependent on fossil fuels and significantly contributes to GHG emissions. The global population is also growing and food demand is expected to increase a 60% by 2050. To combat environmental pollution and create a more sustainable food sector, energy use during manufacturing needs to be reduced. Scope and approach: To gain a better understanding of the energy employed in manufacturing and distribution of foods - within the UK and globally - energy usage within the food industry has been collected from literature and clustered by product, processing technique and transportation method. Key findings and conclusions: Energy figures show that instant coffee, milk powder, French fries, crisps and bread are among the most energy intensive food products. The thermal processes involved in their manufacturing consumed large proportions of the total processing energy. In the meat and dairy processing sectors, energy and water use have increased due to a rise in hygienic standards and cleaning requirements. Additionally, meat products are processed - and sometime over processed - to a higher degree for consumer convenience, all this increasing the associated energy usage for manufacture. Regarding food transportation, more than 98% of all foods within the UK are transported by road, and the distances travelled have increased in recent years. Tertiary distribution using rigid vehicles was the most energy intensive transportation method, while primary distribution at ambient temperature was the least. Refrigerated transportation, which is more intensive than stationary refrigerated systems, has also increased during the past years. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis claims that there exists an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental degradation and income. Recent prominent works have been testing EKC by monitoring the influence of economic development on environmental indicators, such as climate change, ozone layer, air quality, water quality, waste generation, etc., as listed by OECD (2008). These papers/projects follow field studies, survey analyses, time series applications, or panel data analyses. However, mathematical calibrations, or time series and/or panel data estimations for EKC, in general, obtain the parameter estimations that do not change within whole sample period. Although some seminal works consider the structural breaks in cross-sectional dependence tests of panel data, they reveal eventually constant estimates in observing the effect of gross domestic income (GDI) on environmental degradation for the observed time period. Few articles aim at detecting the relevant estimates of coefficients with one or two structural breaks in a dynamic structure. The aim of this work is to analyze the EKC by considering all possible shifts (structural breaks) in estimated parameters. To this end, this chapter follows wavelet model estimations at different time periods corresponding to different time frequencies in the United States for the quarterly period 1980:1–2018:2. This chapter eventually explores that, as GDI of the United States increases, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions tend to increase in the beginning of sample period, whereas it tends to decline during the last years of the observed period. Hence, for the United States, EKC hypothesis is verified by wavelet coherence estimations considering possible strong and weak associations between GDI and CO2. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Triggered by the Fridays for Future movement, policy makers increasingly discuss the introduction of a CO2 tax. Determining an adequate CO2 tax level is complicated for political reasons, but even more so for scientific, economic, and ethical reasons. Through a literature review and subsequent analyses, this study explores the influence of methodological choices on greenhouse gas (GHG) environmental costs, focussing on the European context. Two main approaches exist, relying either on marginal damage costs (MDCs; 17 studies considered) or on marginal abatement costs (MACs; five studies considered). Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) quantify the utility losses for individuals, expressed as MDCs. Only seven of the 17 studies examined policy-relevant GHG MDCs applicable to the European context. Current MDCs are either limited in terms of impacts considered (and those that are included are based on dated cause–effect relationships) or rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP)-based impact functions that disregard, or arbitrarily include, disutility from impacts on non-marketed goods and services, including due to catastrophic events. Therefore, this paper identifies development needs of the IAMs. MACs, in turn, correspond to politically consistent costs to achieve politically set goals, if existing, with no immediate link to the impacts avoided. Depending on the methodological choices made, MDCs and MACs may well span two orders of magnitude. Consensus exists that discounting be conducted at low (social) rates. Primarily moral arguments support the use of equity weighting. Because there are impacts specific to CO2 and CH4 and unrelated to radiative forcing, and because measures differ between GHGs, using global warming potentials (GWPs) for deriving non-CO2 environmental costs from those for CO2 is only a fall-back solution. For a better policy support, MDCs that comprehensively cover climate change impacts and show a high degree of detail should be provided. © 2020},

	abstract = {                             Global livestock husbandry provides ecosystem goods and services but also emits 7.1 Gt CO                             2                             -eq. of greenhouse gases (GHGs) per year. To lower GHG emissions intensity, appropriate production management systems should be identified. Since the 1980s, grassland livestock husbandry in China has transformed gradually from pastoralism into individual household management under the Grassland Household Contract System Policy. However, little is known about how this transition influences GHG emissions. We selected two case study sites representing two different forms of rangeland management systems in Ruoergai county of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, viz. 1) household-based all year continuous grazing under the individual use of rangeland with fences demarcating boundaries; 2) community-based seasonal grazing under the common use of the whole rangeland. The objective was to examine the differences in greenhouse gas emission intensity between the two systems using life cycle assessment (LCA). The results showed that the transition from community-based seasonal grazing into household-based continuous grazing increased the GHG emissions intensity from -0.62 kgCO                             2                             -eq/kg meat to 10.51 kgCO                             2                             -eq/kg meat. The increase was primarily attributed to changes in soil carbon storage. Findings suggest that to minimize GHG emissions and environmental degradation, community-based seasonal grazing in the pastoral area of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau should be maintained. Enhancing soil carbon sequestration by adopting appropriate practices would further reduce the GHG emissions intensity arising from the livestock system.                          © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The global consensus is clear that human activity is mostly to blame for its harmful effects, but there is disagreement about what should be done. While no shortage of proposals from ecological footprints and the polluter pays principle to adaptation technology and economic reforms, each offers a solution – but is climate change a problem we can solve? In this provocative new book, these popular proposals for ending or overcoming the threat of climate change are shown to offer no easy escape and each rest on an important mistake. Thom Brooks argues that a future environmental catastrophe is an event we can only delay or endure, but not avoid. This raises new ethical questions about how we should think about climate change. How should we reconceive sustainability without a status quo? Why is action more urgent and necessary than previously thought? What can we do to motivate and inspire hope? Many have misunderstood the kind of problem that climate change presents – as well as the daunting challenges we must face and overcome. Climate Change Ethics for an Endangered World is a critical guide on how we can better understand the fragile world around us before it is too late. This innovative book will be of great interest to students and scholars of climate change, climate justice, environmental policy and environmental ethics. © 2021 Thom Brooks.},

	abstract = {Hydropower is traditionally considered to be one type of “clean” energy, and has been heavily developed in many regions of the world. Nevertheless, this assumption is increasingly being challenged by recent findings that a large amount of methane and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) are emitted during reservoir creation, turbine operation, and dam decommissioning. Via a critical review of existing hydropower life cycle assessments and reservoir emission studies, we compared the GHG emissions of various types of dams based on their structural type, size, primary function, and geographical location during their construction, operation, and decommissioning phases. Means to improve dam performance and reduce related GHG emissions were identified. It was found that dams with reservoirs usually have much higher GHG emission rates than diversion dams. GHG emissions are mainly generated at the construction and maintenance stages for small-scale run-of-river dams, whereas decomposition of flooded biomass and organic matter in the sediment has the highest GHG emission contribution to large-scale reservoir-based dams. Generally, reservoir-based dams located in boreal and temperate regions have much lower reservoir emissions (3–70 g CO2 eq./kW h) compared with dams located in tropical regions (8–6647 g CO2 eq./kW h). Our analysis shows that although most hydroelectric dams have comparable GHG emissions to other types of renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind energy), electricity produced from tropical reservoir-based dams could potentially have a higher emission rate than fossil-based electricity. © 2018},

The transport option with low GHGs emission did not necessary an option with low air pollutants (SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter) emission. The contradict results are also reflected in the case of water transportation. The limitation of life cycle study (transporting and distribution stage) in evaluating the environmental footprint is also discussed by using the case of the food product.

Further, the proposed methodology is applied to a case study in Japan, an aging, shrinking population. Analysis identifies the increasing burden originating with elderly generations, and due to the resolution offered by the methodology, specifically identifies commodities and services which underpin these future burdens, allowing for policy implications to be drawn.

The study of land-use change has many implications for infrastructure design, resource allocation, and urban metabolism simulation. While most urban models focus on horizontal growth patterns, few investigate the impacts of vertical characteristics of urbanscapes in predicting land-use changes. In this paper, Building-form variables are introduced as a new determinant factor for investigating effects of vertical characteristics of an urbanscape in predicting land-use change. This work outlines an automated method for generating building-form variables from Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data by using Density-Based Spatial Clustering and normal equations. This paper presents a Land-Use Model that uses Remote Sensing, GIS, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict urban growth patterns within the IUMAT framework (Integrated Urban Metabolism Analysis Tool), which is an analytical platform for quantifying the overall sustainability in the urbanscape. The town of Amherst in Western Massachusetts (for the period of 1971–2005) is used as a case study for testing the model. By isolating the weights of each explanatory variable in models, this study highlights the influence of building geometry on future development scenarios. © 2019, College Publishing.

Through a series of engaging case studies, she argues that diverse contemporary natural resource conflicts are underlain by a culturally constituted 'extractivist' mind-set and embedded in global patterns of political inequity. Offering a synthesizing framework for making sense of complex interconnections among environmental, social, and political dimensions of natural resource disputes, Willow reflects on why extractivism exists, why it matters, and what we might be able to do about it.

	abstract = {Consumers are confronted with a confusing array of environmental ratings on products that range from refrigerators to shampoos. Is the information that these ratings represent trustworthy, accurate, or even relevant to environmental concerns? “Information optimists” believe that these “green grades” can play an important role in saving the planet. “Information pessimists” consider them a distraction from pursuing legislative and regulatory actions. In this book, Graham Bullock offers a comprehensive assessment and analysis of the effectiveness and validity of such environmental ratings as ENERGY STAR, USDA Organic, the Forest Stewardship Council, LEED, and the Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index. Bullock stakes out a position as an “information realist," acknowledging both the contributions and the limitations of these initiatives. Drawing on interviews, case studies, and an original dataset of 245 environmental ratings and certifications, he examines what he calls the information value chain of green grades: organizational associations, content, methods, interfaces, and outcomes. He explores the relevance of the information to the issues; the legitimacy and accountability of sponsoring or cooperating organizations; the reliability of methods used to develop the information; the prominence and intelligibility of communication to the public; and the effects and effectiveness of the information after it emerges from the value chain. Bullock’s analysis offers a realistic appraisal of the role of information-based environmental governance -- its benefits and shortcomings -- and its relation to other governance strategies. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

As latent topics like moral values are affected by word polysemy and synonymy, a traditional keyword-based approach is often ineffective and therefore inappropriate. As a result, scientific literature addressing latent topics tends to be fragmented thereby constraining efforts to address similar and complementary research challenges. A novel approach to reviewing the literature by utilizing both semantic fields and probabilistic topic models has therefore been developed. We illustrate this approach by reviewing the literature addressing the value justice in the energy sector and compare this with a regular keyword-based approach. The new approach results in a more complete overview of the relevance of energy justice as compared to the traditional keyword-based approach. This novel approach can be applied to other latent topics including other values or phenomena such as societal resistance to technologies, thereby leading to an increased understanding of existing relevant literature and the identification of new areas of research. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {The potential contribution of organic farming to the public goods, ‘Nature and Biodiversity’, ‘Environment’, ‘Energy and Climate’, ‘Human Health and Welfare’ and ‘Animal Health and Welfare’ in Denmark is guided and partly secured by the principles and specific requirements of the EU Organic Regulation. However, other factors, such as the production type, farm size, geographical location and—not the least—the management of the farm, also influence the contribution. Using the ban on synthetic pesticides and restricted use of antibiotics, including the requirements to compensate for and prevent such uses in organic farming, as examples, the positive and negative contributions of organic farming in relation to selected public goods were analysed. The contributions of organic farming to Nature and Biodiversity and Human and Animal Health and Welfare are mainly positive compared to conventional farming for all farm types, whilst the effects on Environment and Energy and Climate are mixed; i.e. some effects are positive and others are negative. The analysis revealed a need for further documentation and revision of the organic principles and specific organic requirements—in particular in relation to the public goods Energy and Climate, which at present are not addressed in the EU Organic Regulation. Moreover, some organic farming requirements and practices cause dilemmas; e.g. more space per animal and outdoor access improves Animal Health and Welfare but at the same time has negative effects on Environment, Energy Consumption and Climate Change. These dilemmas should be solved before OA may be fully attractive as an integrated policy measure supporting jointly several public goods objectives. © 2017, The Author(s).},

It traces historical development from the feudal Edo period to high income and technology in the current period. Catch-up industrialization is analyzed from a broad perspective including social, economic and political aspects. Historical data, research and contesting arguments are amply supplied. Japan’s unique experience is contrasted with the practices of today’s developing countries. Negative aspects such as social ills, policy failures, military movements and war years are also covered. Nineteenth-century Japan already had a happy combination of strong entrepreneurship and relatively wise government, which was the result of Japan’s long evolutionary history. Measured contacts with high civilizations of China, India and the West allowed cumulative growth without being destroyed by them. Imported ideas and technology were absorbed with adjustments to fit the local context. The book grew out of a graduate course for government officials from developing countries. It offers a comprehensive look and new insights at Japan’s industrial path that are often missing in standard historical chronicles. Written in an accessible and lively form, the book engages scholars as well as novices with no prior knowledge of Japan. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

In this, the Third Edition of the highly successful Conservation Biology: Foundations, Concepts, Applications, the authors address their interdisciplinary topic as it must now be practiced and perceived in the modern world. Beginning with a concise review of the history of conservation, the authors go on to explore the interplay of conservation with genetics, demography, habitat and landscape, aquatic environments, and ecosystem management, and the relationship of all these disciplines to ethics, economics, law, and policy. An entirely new chapter, The Anthropocene: Conservation in a Human-Dominated Nature, breaks new ground in its exploration of how conservation can be practiced in anthropogenic biomes, novel ecosystems, and urban habitats. The Third Edition includes the popular Points of Engagement discussion questions used in earlier editions, and adds a new feature: Information Boxes, which briefly recap specific case histories described in the text. A concluding chapter offers insight into how to become a conservation professional, in both traditional and non-traditional roles. The authors, Fred Van Dyke and Rachel Lamb, draw on their expertise as field biologists, wildlife managers, consultants to government and industry, and scholars of environmental law, policy, and advocacy, as well as their many years of effective teaching experience. Informed by practical knowledge and acquired skills, the authors have created a work of exceptional clarity and readability which encompasses both systemic foundations as well as contemporary developments in the field. Conservation Biology: Foundations, Concepts, Applications will be of invaluable benefit to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as to working conservation scientists and managers. This is an amazing resource for students, faculty, and practitioners both new and experienced to the field.

	abstract = {The research on socio-ecological transformation has thus far focused on the necessity and the possible design of a transformed society. What is missing are empirical studies on the potentials and constraints of such a far-reaching transformation. One reason for this is the necessity to develop complex research designs, particularly, the need to capture the micro-level of subjects, on the one hand, as well as the macro-level of societal structures, on the other hand. A concept that systematically links both levels is that of the 'imperial mode of living'. This paper outlines how the concept can be operationalized. First, different components of the concept are analytically distinguished. Second, how the interpretation of enthymemes can be made productive for analyzing the stability of the imperial mode of living is shown. These insights provide essential background information that can be used to identify strategic entry points for transformative politics towards a degrowth society. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Stabilizing global temperature will require a shift to renewable or nuclear power from fossil power and the large-scale deployment of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) for remaining fossil fuel use. Non-climate co-benefits of low-carbon energy technologies, especially reduced mortalities from air pollution and decreased ecosystem damage, have been important arguments for policies to reduce CO2 emissions. Taking into account a wide range of environmental mechanisms and the complex interactions of the supply chains of different technologies, we conducted the first life cycle assessment of potential human health and ecological impacts of a global low-carbon electricity scenario. Our assessment indicates strong human health benefits of low-carbon electricity. For ecosystem quality, there is a significant trade-off between reduced pollution and climate impacts and potentially significant ecological impacts from land use associated with increased biopower utilization. Other renewables, nuclear power and CCS show clear ecological benefits, so that the climate mitigation scenario with a relatively low share of biopower has lower ecosystem impacts than the baseline scenario. Energy policy can maximize co-benefits by supporting other renewable and nuclear power and developing biomass supply from sources with low biodiversity impact. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The incorporation of clean-fuel technologies has become essential for the sustainability of the transportation sector. Natural gas technology, especially the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG), has become a possible alternative to diesel oil in freight transport because of its acceptable autonomy and low fuel prices. For the introduction of this alternative fuel, freight companies need tools that allow them to perform an integrated assessment of relevant aspects related to environment, economy and social responsibility. This paper introduces a multi-criteria based methodology that integrates the key factors involved in the transport system: vehicles, infrastructure and fuels, and consideration of the three pillars of sustainability, as well as the reliability of technology, legislation and market issues. In particular, a case study for the impact assessment of LNG in comparison to hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and diesel oil as regular long-haul freight transport fuels in Spain was developed. The information for the comparison process was obtained from peer-reviewed articles and reports from international and Spanish institutions, while the primary data was obtained through semi-structured in-depth interviews to the different stakeholders. A weighted sustainability index for each alternative was developed to integrate the data obtained through the analytic hierarchy process. The results indicate that LNG trucks would be an attractive option compared to diesel oil and HVO, provided that decision-makers give significant weight to social and environmental criteria, and that the government guarantees a legislative security to maintain the low taxes on natural gas. Integration of stakeholders allows making the most appropriate decision according to the objectives of the company. The application of the proposed methodology shows consistent results, which should ensure the success of a long-term alternative in the dynamic market for transportation fuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

We are ethically bound to live sustainably for the sake of future generations, but what does that mean? In this book Randall Curren, a philosopher, and Ellen Metzger, a scientist, clarify normative aspects of sustainability. Combining their perspectives, they propose that sustainability can be understood as the art of living well together without diminishing opportunity to live well in the future.Curren and Metzger lay out the nature and value of sustainability, survey the problems, catalog the obstacles, and identify the kind of efforts needed to overcome them. They formulate an ethic of sustainability with lessons for government, organizations, and individuals, and illustrate key ideas with three case studies. Curren and Metzger put intergenerational justice at the heart of sustainability; discuss the need for fair (as opposed to coercive) terms of cooperation to create norms, institutions, and practices conducive to sustainability; formulate a framework for a fundamental ethic of sustainability derived from core components of common morality; and emphasize the importance of sustainability education. The three illustrative case studies focus on the management of energy, water, and food systems, examining the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Australia's National Water Management System, and patterns of food production in the Mekong region of Southeast Asia. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In this paper, we critically examine the sharing economy's prospects and challenges for public sector, and explore the policy responses to the sharing economy. The sharing economy is innovative in capitalizing on underutilized assets using Internet platforms, but has adverse impacts as well (e.g. it could exacerbate inequality). As users, public agencies could adapt internal procurement processes focused on renting, and partner with sharing platforms to complement and supplement public services. As regulators, government agencies have a paradoxical role to maintain the sharing economy's innovation while addressing its downsides. Our study shows mixed policy reactions to sharing economy in three prominent sectors (mobility services, accommodation sharing, and gig labor). We suggest a research agenda that e-government scholars should focus on in order to critically examine the different facets of the emerging sharing economy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {There has been increasing interest in new economic models that aim to improve quality of life without increasing consumption. This article provides the first empirical analysis of how close modern-day economies are to the concept of a "steady-state economy", and explores whether there is any relationship between a country's proximity to such an economy and its social performance. The analysis is carried out using the Degrowth Accounts, a set of 16 biophysical and social indicators that are derived from Herman Daly's definition of a steady-state economy and the social goals of the degrowth movement. These indicators are applied to ∼180 countries over a 10-year period. The analysis reveals that the majority of countries in the world are biophysical growth economies. There are only a small number of countries where resource use is relatively constant from year to year (e.g. Denmark, France, Japan, Poland, Romania, and the US), and only four countries experiencing biophysical degrowth (Germany, Guyana, Moldova, and Zimbabwe). There are no countries that achieve a true steady-state economy, defined as an economy with a stable level of resource use maintained within ecological limits. However, a few countries come relatively close, including Colombia, Cuba, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, and South Africa. In general, countries with stable resource use perform better on many social indicators than countries with either increasing or decreasing resource use. This finding runs contrary to conventional economic thought. However, social performance is also higher in countries with greater per capita resource use. Overall, these findings suggest that a steady-state economy can be socially sustainable, but countries need to become much more efficient at transforming natural resources into human well-being if all seven billion people on Earth are to lead a good life within ecological limits. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Tourism is an increasingly important part of the global economy that is dependent on the annual movement of billions of travelers, often over large distances. The current contribution of the tourism sector to global climate change is reliably established at approximately 5% of CO2 emissions, though national tourism economies can be considerably more carbon-intense. Great uncertainty remains regarding tourism's future emission trajectories. However, in all scenarios, tourism is anticipated to grow substantially and to account for an increasingly large share of global greenhouse gas emissions, particularly if other sectors manage to achieve absolute emission reductions. The emission reduction challenges facing tourism in a low-carbon economy are analyzed and current industry, government, and consumer responses critically examined.

	abstract = {Findings and conclusions: This has resulted in the identification of 277 articles from 69 journals by year of publication, journal, and topic area based on the two classification schemes related to FCO research, published between, 1973 to December- 2014. In addition, the study has identified the 4 dimensions and 98 decision variables affecting the fuel consumption. Also, this study has explained the six categories of FCO research methodologies (analytical - conceptual, mathematical, statistical, and empirical-experimental, statistical, and case studies) and optimization techniques (linear programming, mixed integer programming, dynamic programming, gradient based algorithms, simulation modeling, and nature based algorithms). The findings of this study indicate that the analytical-mathematical research methodologies represent the 47 % of FCO research. The results show that there is an increasing trend in research of the FCO. It is observed that the number of published articles between the period 1973 and 2000 is less (90 articles), so we can say that there are 187 articles which appeared in various journals and other publication sources in the area of FCO since 2000. Furthermore there is increased trend in research on FCO from 2000 onward. This is due to the fact that continuously new researchers are commencing their research activities in FCO research. This shows clearly that FCO research is a current research area among many research groups across the world. Lastly, the prices of jet fuel have significantly increased since the 2005. The aviation sector’s fuel efficiency improvements have slowed down since the 1970s–1980s due to the slower pace of technological development in engine and aerodynamic designs and airframe materials.; We conclude that FCO models need to address the composite fuel consumption problem by extending models to include all the dimensions, i.e. aircraft technology & design, aviation operations & infrastructure, socioeconomic & policy measures, and alternative fuels & fuel properties. FCO models typically comprise all the four dimensions and this reality need to be taken into account in global FCO models. In addition, these models should have objectives or constraints to evaluate the aircraft sizes according to market structure, impact of various policy measures on fuel burn, and near term potential alternative fuel options in the global FCO problem. In the models reviewed, we evaluated that, only the few authors considered these factors. The literature identifies 98 decision variables affecting the fuel consumption related to various dimensions in air transport. So we can conclude that this analysis could represent the informational framework for FCO research in air transport.; Future scope: Our analysis provides a roadmap to guide future research and facilitate knowledge accumulation and creation concerning the application of optimization techniques in fuel consumption of air transport. The addressed dimensions & decision variables could be of potential value to future researchers on the aviation fuel consumption optimization research and is also capable of further refinements. In future, for fuel consumption optimization the explored decision variables could be checked for their reliability and validity and a statistically significant model with minimum number of decision variable could be developed. Further, on the basis of this statistical significant model and with the best market requirement for transport aircraft, the researchers can frame the objective function for fuel consumption minimization problem & decide their dependent variables, independent variables, constant, and constraints. Furthermore, this study will also provide the base for fuel conservation, energy efficiency, and emission reduction in the aviation sector.; Objective: This paper presents a review, classification schemes, critique, a simple meta-analysis and future research implication of fuel consumption optimization (FCO) literature in the air transport sector. This review is based on 277 articles published in various publication outlets between 1973 and 2014.; Methodology: A review of 277 articles related to the FCO in air transport was carried out. It provides an academic database of literature between the periods of 1973– 2014 covering 69 journals and proposes a classification scheme to classify the articles. Twelve hundred of articles were identified and reviewed for their direct relevance to the FCO in air transport. Two hundred seventy seven articles were subsequently selected, reviewed and classified. Each of the 277 selected articles was categorized on four FCO dimensions (Aircraft technology & design, aviation operations & infrastructure, socioeconomic & policy measures, and alternate fuels & fuel properties). The articles were further classified into six categories of FCO research methodologies (analytical - conceptual, mathematical, statistical, and empirical- experimental, statistical, and case studies) and optimization techniques (linear programming, mixed integer programming, dynamic programming, gradient based algorithms, simulation modeling, and nature based algorithms). In addition, a simple meta-analysis was also carried out to enhance understanding of the development and evolution of research in the FCO. © 2015, The Author(s).},

The author elaborates the role of the public in the discourse about environmental protection. As the public consists of socio-economic, legal and political actors, the behavior of those actors is of significance. With a thorough analysis of the International Social Survey Programme, this book illustrates the rocky road from the perception of environmental threats to the reaction toward them. Combining a constructivist and rational choice perspective, the author points out that there are distinctive differences between individual countries in the perception, evaluation as well as in the reaction toward environmental issues. Neither is there a uniform path from perception to reaction, nor exists a one-size-fits-all-solution. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften. All rights reserved.},

The empirical material was gathered with urban freight (courier) company managers and drivers in Aotearoa New Zealand. It presents personal accounts of the everyday lived experiences of those intimately involved in the delivery of goods within the urban environment. Twenty-five interviews were conducted across four urban centres between June and September 2015. We use the four elements of the Energy Cultures Framework to explore what urban freight managers and drivers 'have', 'do' and 'think', and the pressures of an external context. Four interrelated themes are presented. 1. Online shopping and home deliveries, 2. Tracking and transparency, 3. New technologies, and 4. Meeting (changing) expectations, with evidence provided by way of verbatim quotations. The 'mobility cultures' concept is used to explore the relationships between the four themes, and to identify the key change trends that may affect the ability of the freight industry to contribute to a low-carbon transport transition. We conclude by signalling some policy implications and future research directions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

The compression of freight transit times has been one of the most enduring logistics trends but may not be compatible with governmental climate change policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60–80% by 2050. Opportunities for cutting CO2 emissions by ‘despeeding' are explored within a freight decarbonisation framework and split into three categories: direct, indirect and consequential. Discussion of the direct carbon savings focuses on the trucking and deep-sea container sectors, where there is clear evidence that slower operation cuts cost, energy and emissions and can be accommodated within current supply chain requirements. Indirect emission reductions could accrue from more localised sourcing and a relaxation of just-in-time (JIT) replenishment. Acceleration of logistical activities other than transport could offset increases in freight transit times, allowing the overall carbon intensity of supply chains to reduce with minimal loss of performance. Consequential deceleration results from other decarbonisation initiatives such as freight modal split and a shift to lower carbon fuels. Having reviewed evidence drawn from a broad range of sources, the paper concludes that freight deceleration is a promising decarbonisation option, but raises a number of important issues that will require new empirical research. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Past Assessments The topics assessed in this chapter were last assessed by the IPCC in 2007, principally in WGII AR4 Chapters 3 (Kundzewicz et al., 2007) and 4 (Fischlin et al., 2007), but also in WGII AR4 Sections 1.3.4 and 1.3.5 (Rosenzweig et al., 2007). The WGII AR4 SPM stated "Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases," though they noted that documentation of observed changes in tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere was sparse (Rosenzweig et al., 2007). Fischlin et al. (2007) found that 20 to 30% of the plant and animal species that had been assessed to that time were considered to be at increased risk of extinction if the global average temperature increase exceeds 2°C to 3°C above the preindustrial level with medium confidence, and that substantial changes in structure and functioning of terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems are very likely under that degree of warming and associated atmospheric CO2 concentration. No time scale was associated with these findings. The carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems were considered to be at high risk from climate change and land use change. The report warned that the capacity of ecosystems to adapt naturally to the combined effect of climate change and other stressors is likely to be exceeded if greenhouse gas (GHG) emission continued at or above the then-current rate. 4.2. A Dynamic and Inclusive View of Ecosystems There are three aspects of the contemporary scientific view of ecosystems that are important to know for policy purposes. First, ecosystems usually have imprecise and variable boundaries. They span a wide range of spatial scales, nested within one another, from the whole biosphere, down through its major ecosystem types (biomes), to local and possibly short-lived associations of organisms. Second, the human influence on ecosystems is globally pervasive. Humans are regarded as an integral, rather than separate, part of social-ecological systems (Gunderson and Holling, 2001; Berkes et al., 2003). © Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2014.},

	abstract = {The study presents the measurement of carbonyl, BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene), ammonia, elemental/organic carbon (EC/OC), and greenhouse gas emissions from modern heavy-duty diesel and natural gas vehicles. Vehicles from different vocations that included goods movement, refuse trucks, and transit buses were tested on driving cycles representative of their duty cycle. The natural gas vehicle technologies included the stoichiometric engine platform equipped with a three-way catalyst and a diesel-like dual-fuel high-pressure direct-injection technology equipped with a diesel particulate filter (DPF) and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The diesel vehicles were equipped with a DPF and SCR. Results of the study show that the BTEX emissions were below detection limits for both diesel and natural gas vehicles, while carbonyl emissions were observed during cold start and low-temperature operations of the natural gas vehicles. Ammonia emissions of about 1 g/mile were observed from the stoichiometric natural gas vehicles equipped with TWC over all the driving cycles. The tailpipe GWP of the stoichiometric natural gas goods movement application was 7% lower than DPF and SCR equipped diesel. In the case of a refuse truck application the stoichiometric natural gas engine exhibited 22% lower GWP than a diesel vehicle. Tailpipe methane emissions contribute to less than 6% of the total GHG emissions. Implications: Modern heavy-duty diesel and natural gas engines are equipped with multiple after-treatment systems and complex control strategies aimed at meeting both the performance standards for the end user and meeting stringent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions regulation. Compared to older technology diesel and natural gas engines, modern engines and after-treatment technology have reduced unregulated emissions to levels close to detection limits. However, brief periods of inefficiencies related to low exhaust thermal energy have been shown to increase both carbonyl and nitrous oxide emissions. © 2016 A&WMA.},

Moreover, the least-compensated university sub-population, non-professional staff (i.e., office support, grounds keepers), is significantly more likely to contribute to a dramatically larger per-capita percentage of the university's carbon footprint from commuting.

This insightful book provides a theoretically grounded but also realistic account of how the design of business models can be a critical component in the overall transition to sustainability, and one that transcends the usual focus on innovative technology. Weaving together key principles and components for business sustainability, the book highlights five very different pathways to the future for sectors ranging from microbreweries and printing through to clothing, mobility and plastics. Business has only just started the first few tentative steps towards a very different approach to creating and sustaining value, but this book concludes that enormous opportunities will emerge alongside new ways of creating and capturing value. Academics and postgraduate students in the fields of sustainable business, business organisations and industrial ecology will find this book brings a greater understanding of business strategy and structure to the discipline.

If one withdraws from nuclear energy today there is the inevitable risk of having to depend on alternative energy technologies in the future, all of which have their own specific drawbacks. It is therefore better to consider whole energy mixes rather than single energy technologies. Furthermore, the risks and benefits of nuclear energy need to be compared with the risks attached to renewables or fossil fuels. Assessing energy mixes thus warrants a long-term perspective and the developing of scenario analyses. The risks of specific energy mixes are not only linked to the different energy technologies themselves but also to energy demand, in other words, to the intensity of industrial and household energy consumption, the energy efficiency of various technologies, and, from a global perspective, population growth. It is often the negative impact of increasing energy consumption that prompts authors of global energy studies to call for countermeasures that can considerably impede individual autonomy. Not only people's second car might come into the firing line but there might also be pressure to generally reduce consumer goods expenditure or even the birth rate. For instance, a recent Club of Rome report based China's ability to achieve sustainable production and consumption on its ability to address the population challenge (Randers 2012). This theory was linked to China's Confucian tradition as evidenced in meritocracy and centralized government and often contrasted with the alleged inability of democratic societies to react adequately to environmental problems. Still, it does not seem easy to square the overall perspective on environmental problems with the worries about single individuals, their autonomy, and their well-being: Does sustainable energy supply really necessitate intervention into otherwise very private decisions such as choosing the number of children one has - decisions that may be considered sacrosanct when juxtaposed to government intervention? If so, a serious conflict between sustainability and other values in the social realm, such as democratic participation, is likely to arise. © 2015, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

With wildlife populations and biodiversity riches threatened across the globe, it is obvious that new and innovative methods of addressing the crisis are vital to the future of the planet. But is “the market” the answer? As public funding for conservation efforts grows ever scarcer and the private sector is brimming with ideas about how its role-along with its profits— can grow, market forces have found their way into environmental management to a degree unimaginable only a few years ago. Ecotourism, payment for environmental services (PES), and new conservation finance instruments such as species banking, carbon trading, and biodiversity derivatives are only some of the market mechanisms that have sprung into being. This is “Nature™ Inc.”: a fast-growing frontier of networks, activities, knowledge, and regulations that are rapidly changing the relations between people and nature on both global and local scales. Nature™ Inc. brings together cutting-edge research by respected scholars from around the world to analyze how “neoliberal conservation” is reshaping human-nature relations that have been fashioned over two centuries of capitalist development. Contributors synthesize and add to a growing body of academic literature that cuts across the disciplinary boundaries of geography, sociology, anthropology, political science, and development studies to critically interrogate the increasing emphasis on neoliberal market-based mechanisms in environmental conservation. They all grapple with one overriding question: can capitalist market mechanisms resolve the environmental problems they have helped create? © 2014 The Arizona Board of Regents. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Today, global land use is affected by a variety of factors, including urbanization and the growing interconnectedness of economies and markets. This book examines the challenges and opportunities we face in achieving sustainable land use in the twenty-first century. While land resources remain finite, the global population is projected to reach ten billion by the end of the century, bringing issues of ethics and fairness to center stage. Who should decide how land is used? Where does competition for land occur, and why? Moreover, accelerating globalization, increasing demand for animal protein in our diets, the need for new sources of energy, and the global scarcity of land have led to a decoupling of land use and local control, which raises issues of governance. The contributors, from a range of disciplines and countries, present new analytical perspectives and tools for understanding key issues in global land use. The chapters consider such topics as food production and land use; case studies of urbanization and agriculture in Brazil and China; telecoupling and connections to distant places; emerging institutions of land-use governance; public and private regulation of land use; uniquely urban issues of land use; and future steps to sustainability. © 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

	abstract = {This paper provides new knowledge about the life-cycle emissions of natural gas compared to traditional petroleum-based fuels in the marine sector. While natural gas will reduce local air pollutants, such as sulfur oxides and particulate matter, the implications for greenhouse gases depend on how the natural gas is extracted, processed, distributed, and used. Applying a "technology warming potential" (TWP) approach, natural gas as a marine fuel achieves climate parity within 30 years for diesel ignited engines, though could take up to 190 years to reach climate parity with conventional fuels in a spark ignited engine. Movement towards natural gas as a marine fuel continues to progress, and conditions exist in some regions to make a near-term transition to natural gas feasible. Liquefied natural gas in marine transportation is likely to be incentivized where economics favoring natural gas is coupled with air emissions public policy targets. To ensure that climate neutral conversion is achieved with the least delay, TWP results highlight the important role of energy policy for infrastructure development of upstream pathways and onboard ship systems technology innovation. © 2015 The Authors.},

Consumption is also at the heart of many of our most critical ecological, health, and social problems. What is referred to broadly as sustainable consumption has primarily focused on making consumption more efficient and gradually decoupling it from energy and resource use. We argue for the need to focus sustainable consumption initiatives on the key impact areas of consumption-transport, housing, energy use, and food-and at deeper levels of system change. To meet the scale of the sustainability challenges we face, interventions and policies must move from relative decoupling via technological improvements, to strategies to change the behavior of individual consumers, to broader initiatives to change systems of production and consumption. We seek to connect these emerging literatures on behavior change, structural interventions, and sustainability transitions to arrive at integrated frameworks for learning, iteration, and scaling of sustainability innovations. We sketch the outlines of research and practice that offer potentials for system changes for truly sustainable consumption. © 2015 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Energy saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction in China is attracting increasing attention worldwide. At present, China is in the phase of rapid urbanization and industrialization, which is characterized by rapid growth of energy consumption. China's transport sector is highly energy-consuming and pollution-intensive. Between 1980 and 2012, the carbon dioxide emissions in China's transport sector increased approximately 9.7 times, with an average annual growth rate of 7.4%. Identifying the driving forces of the increase in carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector is vital to developing effective environmental policies. This study uses Vector Autoregressive model to analyze the influencing factors of the changes in carbon dioxide emissions in the sector. The results show that energy efficiency plays a dominant role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Private vehicles have more impact on emission reduction than cargo turnover due to the surge in private car population and its low energy efficiency. Urbanization also has significant effect on carbon dioxide emissions because of large-scale population movements and the transformation of the industrial structure. These findings are important for the relevant authorities in China in developing appropriate energy policy and planning for the transport sector. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Rural areas include diverse patterns of settlement, infrastructure, and livelihoods, and relate in complex ways with urban areas. The chapter shows that rural areas experience specific vulnerabilities to climate change, both through their dependence on natural resources and weather-dependent activities and their relative lack of access to information, decision making, investment, and services. Adaptation strategies will need to address these vulnerabilities. Some of the key starting points, which affect the scope and coverage of literature assessed in this chapter, are as follows: • Rural areas, even after significant demographic shifts, still account for 3.3 billion people, or almost half (47.9%) of the world’s total population (UN DESA Population Division, 2013). • The overwhelming majority of the world’s rural population (3.1 billion people, or 91.7% of the world’s rural population, or 44.0% of the world’s total population) live in less developed or least developed countries (UN DESA Population Division, 2013). • Rural dwellers also account for about 70% of the developing world’s poor people. IFAD (2010) states that around 70% of the extreme poor in developing countries lived in rural areas in 2005. Ravallion et al. (2007), using 2002 data and poverty lines of US$1.08 or US$2.15, in each case with urban poverty lines adjusted upward to recognize additional non-food spending, give a figure of around 75% of people, under either poverty line, being rural. • Rural areas are a spatial category, associated with certain patterns of human activity, but with those associations being subject to continuous change. • Rural areas are largely defined in contradistinction to urban areas, but that distinction is increasingly seen as problematic. • Rural populations have, and will have, a variety of income sources and occupations, within which agriculture and the exploitation of natural resources have privileged, but not necessarily predominant, positions. © Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2014.},

Even if we arrive at a Hubbert's peak for oil extraction in the 21st century, the availability of technologically recoverable coal and natural gas will mean that fossil fuels continue to be burned for many years to come, and our civilization will have to deal with the consequences far into the future. Climate change will not discriminate between rich and poor nations, and yet the UN-driven process of negotiating a global climate governance regime has hit serious roadblocks. This book takes a trans-disciplinary perspective to identify the causes of failure in developing an international climate policy regime and lays out a roadmap for developing a post-Kyoto (post-2012) climate governance regime in the light of lessons learned from the Kyoto phase. Three critical policy analytical lenses are used to evaluate the inherent complexity of designing post-Kyoto climate policy: the politics of scale; the politics of ideology; and the politics of knowledge. The politics of scale lens focuses on the theme of temporal and spatial discounting observed in human societies and how it impacts the allocation of environmental commons and natural resources across space and time. The politics of ideology lens focuses on the themes of risk and uncertainty perception in complex, pluralistic human societies. The politics of knowledge lens focuses on the themes of knowledge and power dynamics in terms of governance and policy designs, such as marketization of climate governance observed in the Kyoto institutional regime. © 2013 Asim Zia.

Part One outlines the challenges and investigates the human factors: population growth; urbanization and pollution; the commercialization of water, including globalization and privatization; and the impacts of war, terrorism and the credit crunch. Part Two examines the physical aspects: the restless water cycle, the impact of past and future climate change and the problems change and unreliability create for water management. Part Three discusses current and future solutions including improved efficiency and water treatment systems, desalination, weather modification and rainwater harvesting, and improved legal and administrative frameworks. Jones concludes by asking how far technical and financial innovations can overcome the limitations of climatic resources and examining the human and environmental costs involved in such developments.

	abstract = {This timely book offers a unique interdisciplinary inquiry into the prospects of different political narratives on climate migration. It identifies the essential angles on climate migration - the humanitarian narrative, the migration narrative and the climate change narrative - and assesses their prospects. The author contends that although such arguments will influence global governance, they will not necessarily achieve what advocates hope for. He discusses how the weaknesses of the concept of "climate migration" are likely to be utilized in favour of repressive policies against migration or for the defence of industrial nations against perceived threats from the Third World. © Benoît Mayer 2016.

Global energy security and access is one of the central justice issues of our time, with profound implications for happiness, welfare, freedom, equity, and due process. This book combines up-to-date data on global energy security and climate change with fresh perspectives on the meaning of justice in social decision-making. Benjamin K. Sovacool and Michael H. Dworkin address how justice theory can help people to make more meaningful decisions about the production, delivery, use, and effects of energy. Exploring energy dilemmas in real-life situations, they link recent events to eight global energy injustices and employ philosophy and ethics to make sense of justice as a tool in the decision-making process. They go on to provide remedies and policies that planners and individuals can utilize to create a more equitable and just energy future. © Benjamin K. Sovacool and Michael H. Dworkin 2014.},

	abstract = {The natural gas extraction method of high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) has a significant truck transportation component, with estimates ranging from 625 to 1,148 heavy truck trips for equipment, materials, and waste movement for each well drilled in the Marcellus Shale. ArcGIS Network Analyst was used to analyze the environmental impacts of transporting sand and water to, and waste from, Pennsylvania wells from 2011 to 2013. The locations of wells, resource supply areas, and waste disposal facilities served as a series of origin and destination pairings for probable truck routes. Material and waste volumes per well were used to estimate the truck counts assigned to each route, leading to estimates of truck traffic by road segment. Emission loads and energy usage were calculated with the geospatial intermodal freight transport model. Simulation results of 22-ton loads estimated 4.4 million one-way truck trips totaling nearly 86.5 million vehicle miles and producing nearly 19 Mg of particulate matter and 745 Mg of nitro-gen oxides, among other pollutants. Maps showing road segments with high truck counts identified areas of potential health and infrastructure impacts. On-site recycling of wastes offset an estimated 842,678 truck trips and associated emissions. Case studies developed during this project pointed to the need for better data collection and data distribution efforts in states extracting gas and those considering whether to allow HVHF operations. The results will help policy analysts and environmental planners to understand and evaluate the environmental, health, and economic impacts (pro and con) associated with the movement of HVHF equipment and materials. © 2015, SAGE Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {The Central America (CA) and South America (SA) region harbors unique ecosystems and has the highest biodiversity on the planet and a variety of eco-climatic gradients. Unfortunately, this natural wealth is threatened by advancing agricultural frontiers resulting from a rapidly growing agricultural and cattle production (Grau and Aide, 2008). The region experienced a steady economic growth, accelerated urbanization, and important demographic changes in the last decade; poverty and inequality are decreasing continuously, but at a low pace (ECLAC, 2011c). Adaptive capacity is improving in part thanks to poverty alleviation and development initiatives (McGray et al., 2007). The region has multiple stressors on natural and human systems derived in part from significant land use changes and exacerbated by climate variability/climate change. Climate variability at various time scales has been affecting social and natural systems, and extremes in particular have affected large regions. In Central and South America, 613 climatological and hydro-meteorological extreme events occurred in the period 2000-2013, resulting in 13,883 fatalities, 53.8 million people affected, and economic losses of US$52.3 billion (www.emdat.be). Land is facing in creasing pressure from competing uses such as cattle ranching, food production, and bioenergy. The region is regarded as playing a key role in the future world economy because countries such as Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Panama, among others, are rapidly developing and becoming economically important in the world scenario. The region is bound to be exposed to the pressure related to increasing land use and industrialization. Therefore, it is expected to have to deal with increasing emission potentials. Thus, science-based decision making is thought to be an important tool to control innovation and development of the countries in the region. Two other important contrasting features characterize the region: having the biggest tropical forest of the planet on the one side, and possessing the largest potential for agricultural expansion and development during the next decades on the other. © Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2014.},

	abstract = {In the past few years, numerous authors have highlighted the emergence of transnational climate initiatives, such as city networks, private certification schemes, and business self-regulation in the policy domain of climate change. While these transnational governance arrangements can surely contribute to solving the problem of climate change, their development by different types of sub- and non-state actors does not imply a weakening of the intergovernmental level. On the contrary, many transnational climate initiatives use the international climate regime as a point of reference and have adopted various rules and procedures from international agreements. Rethinking Authority in Global Climate Governance puts forward this argument and expands upon it, using case studies which suggest that the effective operation of transnational climate initiatives strongly relies on the existence of an international regulatory framework created by nation-states. Thus, this book emphasizes the centrality of the intergovernmental process clustered around the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and underscores that multilateral treaty-making continues to be more important than many scholars and policy-makers suppose. © 2016 Thomas Hickmann.},

	abstract = {This book applies concepts from ethics, justice, and political philosophy to five sets of contemporary energy problems cutting across time, economics, politics, geography, and technology.; In doing so, the authors derive two key energy justice principles from modern theories of distributive justice, procedural justice, and cosmopolitan justice. The prohibitive principle states that “energy systems must be designed and constructed in such a way that they do not unduly interfere with the ability of people to acquire those basic goods to which they are justly entitled.” The affirmative principle states that “if any of the basic goods to which people are justly entitled can only be secured by means of energy services, then in that case there is also a derivative entitlement to the energy services.” In laying out and employing these principles, the book details a long list of current energy injustices ranging from human rights abuses and energy-related civil conflict to energy poverty and pervasive and growing negative externalities.; The book illustrates the significance of energy justice by combining the most up-to-date data on global energy security and climate change, including case studies and examples from the electricity supply, transport, and heating and cooking sectors, with appraisals based on centuries of thought about the meaning of justice in social decisions. © 2014 Benjamin K.

	abstract = {Cities are dependent on their hinterlands for their function and survival. They provide resources such as people, materials, water, food and energy, as well as areas for waste disposal. Over the last 50 years, commerce and trade has become increasingly global with resources sourced from further afield often due to cheap labour costs, better transportation and a plentiful supply of energy and raw materials. However, the use and transportation of resources is becoming increasingly unsustainable as the global population increases, raw materials become increasing scarce, and energy costs rise. This paper builds on research undertaken in the Liveable Cities Programme on the resource flows of Birmingham, UK. It investigates how people, material, and food flows interact within regional, national, and international hinterlands through road and rail transportation and assesses their sustainability across all three pillars (economic, social, and environmental). The type and weight of goods is highlighted together with their costs and energy used. For a city to move with greatest effect towards sustainability it needs to: (i) source as much as it can locally, to minimise transportation and energy costs; (ii) adopt such principles as the "circular economy"; and (iii) provide clean and efficient means to move people, especially public transportation. © 2016 by the authors.},

First, well-being outcomes are assessed, defined in terms of access to education, democratic and legal rights, and the infrastructures that support physical health. Second, emissions trajectories are estimated to 2050, taking into account current trends in energy consumption and carbon intensity, a likely start-date for stringent climate policy arising from the Paris Agreement (2020), and maximum feasible rates of mitigation. Comparing these estimates to a per capita allocation from the global carbon budget associated with 2 °C, ten countries have low-carbon development trends that will not exceed their allocation. Of these, Costa Rica and Uruguay are achieving very high well-being outcomes, while many more are delivering good outcomes in at least two domains of human need. However, most are seriously deficient in terms of social well-being (education, democratic and legal rights). These results call into question the socio-economic convergence of developing countries with industrialised countries; but they also reaffirm the low-emissions cost of extending good infrastructure access and physical health outcomes to all, demonstrated by the existence of multiple countries that continue to avoid carbon-intensive development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss in terrestrial environments associated with human activities has been appreciated as a major issue for some years now. What is less well documented is the effect of such activities, including climate change, on marine biodiversity. This pioneering book is the first to address this important but neglected topic, which is likely to be the key challenge for marine scientists in the near future. Using a multidisciplinary and a holistic approach, the book reveals how climatic variability controls biodiversity at time scales ranging from synoptic meteorological events to millions of years and at spatial scales ranging from local sites to the whole ocean. It shows how global change, including anthropogenic climate change, ocean acidification and more direct human influences such as exploitation, pollution and eutrophication may alter biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and regulating and provisioning services. The author proposes a theory termed the 'macroecological theory on the arrangement of life', which explains how biodiversity is organized and how it responds to climatic variability and anthropogenic climate change. The book concludes with recommendations for further research and theoretical development to identify oceanic areas in need of observation and gaps in current scientific knowledge. Many references and comparisons with the terrestrial realm are included in all chapters to better understand the universality of the relationships between biodiversity, climate and the environment. The book will serve as a textbook for all students and researchers of marine science and environmental change, but will also be accessible to the more general reader. © 2015 Grégory Beaugrand.

	abstract = {While the effects of climate change become ever more apparent and pressing, the discussion of sustainable practices and environmental protection is a common overture among the academic and scientific communities. However, in order to be truly effective, sustainable solutions must be tested and applied in real-world situations. Sustainability Science for Social, Economic, and Environmental Development investigates the role of sustainability in the everyday lives of ordinary citizens, including issues of economy, social interaction, exploitation of natural resources, and sources of renewable energy. In this book, researchers, policy makers, economists, scientists, and general readers will all find crucial insight into the parallels between theory and practice in sustainable development. © 2014 by IGI Global.

	abstract = {At the strategic level, multimodal freight network design problems are limited in that they reflect the costs and constraints associated with emissions. The network design problem (NDP) addressed in this study determines investment alternatives for minimizing total system cost, including costs related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while satisfying the emissions constraint. The NDP can accommodate improvement alternatives in transfer terminals as well as in road and railroad links. In this study, mode-specific travel time functions were used to represent the differences between the modes explicitly, even for the transfer facility. Emission factors were calculated by link travel speed and level of facilities. The empirical application to a container freight network from the Port of Pusan in southeastern South Korea showed the optimal investment strategy for meeting emissions reduction policy objectives. The conclusion is that investment should concentrate on railroad and terminal facilities to induce modal shift. In contrast, investment in congested roads might be a better option for corridors in which the level of railroad service is low and short-distance freight demands are dominant. These results indicate that the proposed network design problem can provide the appropriate investment strategy for reducing GHG emissions and therefore can be a useful approach with regard to GHG emissions reduction policy.},

	abstract = {The life-cycle output (e.g., level of service) of infrastructure systems heavily influences their normalized environmental footprint. Many studies and tools calculate emission factors based on average productivity; however, the performance of these systems varies over time and space. We evaluate the appropriate use of emission factors based on average levels of service by comparing them to those reflecting a distribution of system outputs. For the provision of truck and bus services where fuel economy is assumed constant over levels of service, emission factor estimation biases, described by Jensen's inequality, always result in larger-than-expected environmental impacts (3%-400%) and depend strongly on the variability and skew of truck payloads and bus ridership. Well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emission factors for diesel trucks in California range from 87 to 1,500 g of CO2 equivalents per ton-km, depending on the size and type of trucks and the services performed. Along a bus route in San Francisco, well-to-wheel emission factors ranged between 53 and 940 g of CO2 equivalents per passenger-km. The use of biased emission factors can have profound effects on various policy decisions. If average emission rates must be used, reflecting a distribution of productivity can reduce emission factor biases. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

The BATS (Broadband Access via integrated Terrestrial and Satellite systems) project has based its assessments on the GHG Protocol approach, with the ETSI LCA and ITU-T L.1400 methodology series used to provide more detailed guidance where this is needed. This assessment has shown that it is possible to employ cut off rules and approximations to reduce the cost or length of an assessment and still provide useful results. The assessment has shown that, using current technology for the IUG and satellite modem, the carbon footprint of a hybrid broadband satellite network can be comparable with that of a terrestrial (fixed or mobile) network for an equivalent level of service when the use of low-power states are considered. The implementation of these states in future commercial systems should be explored. Finally ways are suggested to reduce the environmental impact of hybrid broadband satellite systems, in particular by reducing energy (power) consumption during the use stage. Key issues include how to compare the energy efficiency of a hybrid broadband satellite network with other methods of broadband delivery, how to accurately assess the carbon embodied during the production of the equipment, and how to use low-power modes to reduce energy consumption without affecting the response time or quality of experience (QoE). © 2015, IGI Global.

	abstract = {Over the past century, agricultural landscapes worldwide have increasingly been managed for the primary purpose of producing food, while other diverse ecosystem services potentially available from these landscapes have often been undervalued and diminished. The incorporation of relatively small amounts of perennial vegetation in strategic locations within agricultural landscapes dominated by annual crops - or perennialization - creates an opportunity for enhancing the provision of a wide range of goods and services to society, such as water purification, hydrologic regulation, pollination services, control of pest and pathogen populations, diverse food and fuel products, and greater resilience to climate change and extreme disturbances, while at the same time improving the sustainability of food production. This paper synthesizes the current scientific theory and evidence for the role of perennial plants in balancing conservation with agricultural production, focusing on the Midwestern USA as a model system, while also drawing comparisons with other climatically diverse regions of the world. Particular emphasis is given to identifying promising opportunities for advancement and critical gaps in our knowledge related to purposefully integrating perennial vegetation into agroecosystems as a management tool for maximizing multiple benefits to society.

	abstract = {The market for renewable fuels for transportation applications has grown significantly in recent years due to governmental regulations at the local, regional, and national levels throughout the world. One of the most important requirements for expanding the use of alternative fuels in transportation applications is to understand how these fuels might impact vehicle performance and emissions, and to understand their compatibility with different vehicle/engine technologies. Some fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel have been extensively studied in this regard and are used widely in the current marketplace. Other fuels such as butanol, dimethyl ether (DME), and renewable diesel and jet fuel, or new potential fuels such as pentanol, dimethyl carbonate (DMC), 2,5- Dimethylfuran (DMF), and P-series fuels have either not been studied extensively or have not been extensively used in the transportation fuel marketplace. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of how the use of alternative fuels impacts the transportation sector, in terms of how the fuels are utilized and their emissions/performance impacts. This includes a brief introduction to how each of the fuels is commonly produced, a subsection on the unique characteristics of each fuel and how that impacts how the fuel is or could be utilized in motor vehicles, and finally a subsection on emissions, performance, and other potential environmental impacts of the different fuels. This chapter includes ethanol and biodiesel, other alcohols and ethers, such as butanol, methanol, pentanol, and DME, Fischer-Tropsch (F-T), gas-to-liquid (GTL), and renewable diesels, and some newer alternative fuel options, such as DMC, DMF, and P-series fuel.

Planning Sustainable Cities and Regions is the first book to explain what this grand experiment tells us about the most just path moving forward for cities and regions across the globe. The book offers chapters about neighbourhoods, the economy, and poverty, using stories from practice to help solve puzzles posed by academic research. Based on the most recent demographic and economic trends, it overturns conventional ideas about how to build more livable places and vibrant economies that offer opportunity to all. This thought-provoking book provides a framework to deal with the new inequities created by the movement for more livable - and expensive - cities, so that our best plans for sustainability are promoting more equitable development as well.

	abstract = {Reductions in the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of passenger and freight transportation are possible through adoption of fuel-saving technologies, demand switching between modes, and large-scale electrification of fleets, in addition to other actions. In this study, future scenarios to 2030 and 2050 are the basis for assessment of GHG reduction potentials for major passenger and freight modes (automobiles, buses, trains, aircraft, and oceangoing vessels) across eight regions of the world. New fuel-saving technologies can significantly reduce the life-cycle GHG footprint of both passenger and freight vehicles, but not uniformly worldwide. Countries outside of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) lag behind OECD countries in GHG reduction potentials for all modes but oceangoing vessels owing to a combination of slower adoption of fuel-saving technologies and a slower decarbonization of electricity generation and other processes. The reduction of GHG intensity will occur more slowly for freight modes than for passenger modes. However, improved fuel efficiency has negative feedbacks to the effectiveness of mode-switching and alternative fuel adoption policies through 2050 because improvements in the fuel efficiency of vehicles alone may cause the marginal benefits of GHG abatement policies to diminish over time. This trend may be reversed if alternative fuel pathways decarbonize at faster rates than conventional transportation fuels. The largest opportunities for GHG reductions occur in non-OECD countries. Given the many factors that distinguish transportation systems between developed and developing nations (e.g., availability of new technologies, the financial ability to acquire them, and policies to incentivize their adoption), many benefits could be gained through interregional cooperation. © 2016, Yale University.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, considerable attention has been devoted in the scientific literature and in the media to the concept of "ecosystem" services of soils. The monetary valuation of these services, demanded by many governments and international agencies, is often depicted as a necessary condition for the preservation of the natural capital that soils represent. This focus on soil services is framed in the context of a general interest in ecosystem services that allegedly started in 1997, and took off in earnest after 2005. The careful analysis of the literature proposed in this article shows that, in fact, interest in the multifunctionality of soils emerged already in the mid-60s, at a time when hundreds of researchers worldwide were trying, and largely failing, to figure out how to put price tags meaningfully on "nature's services." Soil scientists, since, have tried to better understand various functions/services of soils, as well as their possible relation with key soil characteristics, like biodiversity. They have also tried to make progress on the challenging quantification of soil functions/services. However, researchers have manifested very little interest in monetary valuation, undoubtedly in part because it is not clear what economic and financial markets might do with prices of soil functions/services, even if we could somehow come up with such numbers, and because there is no assurance at all, based on neoclassical economic theory, that markets would manage soil resources optimally. Instead of monetary valuation, focus in the literature has been put on decision-making methods that, among other features, do not require the systematic monetization of soil functions/services. Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) have the added advantage that they allow the effect of parameter uncertainties to be accounted for, whereas Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods easily accommodate deliberative approaches involving a variety of stakeholders. A prerequisite to progress in such public deliberations is that participants be very cognizant of the extreme relevance of soils to many aspects of their daily life. We argue that, as long as this prerequisite is satisfied, the combination of deliberative decision-making methods and of a sound scientific approach to the quantification of soil functions/services (including uncertainties) is a very promising avenue to manage effectively and ethically the priceless heritage that soils constitute. copy; 2016 Baveye, Baveye and Gowdy.},

	abstract = {The future is not what it used to be because we can no longer rely on the comforting assumption that it will resemble the past. Past abundance of fuel, for example, does not imply unending abundance. Infinite growth on a finite planet is not possible. In this book, Jörg Friedrichs argues that industrial society itself is transitory, and he examines the prospects for our civilization’s coming to terms with its two most imminent choke points: Climate change and energy scarcity. He offers a thorough and accessible account of these two challenges as well as the linkages between them.Friedrichs contends that industrial civilization cannot outlast our ability to burn fossil fuels and that the demise of industrial society would entail cataclysmic change, including population decreases. To understand the social and political implications, he examines historical cases of climate stress and energy scarcity: Devastating droughts in the ancient Near East; the Little Ice Age in the medieval Far North; the Japanese struggle to prevent –fuel starvation— from 1918 to 1945; the –totalitarian retrenchment— of the North Korean governing class after the end of Soviet oil deliveries; and Cuba’s socioeconomic adaptation to fuel scarcity in the 1990s. He draws important lessons about the likely effects of climate and energy disruptions on different kinds of societies.The warnings of climate scientists are met by denial and inaction, while energy experts offer little guidance on the effects of future scarcity. Friedrichs suggests that to confront our predicament we must affirm our core values and take action to transform our way of life. Whether we are private citizens or public officials, complacency is not an option: Climate change and energy scarcity are emerging facts of life. © 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

	abstract = {• Background Agricultural systems are amended ecosystems with a variety of properties. Modern agroecosystems have tended towards high through-flowsystems, with energy supplied by fossil fuels directed out of the system (either deliberately for harvests or accidentally through side effects). In the coming decades, resource constraints overwater, soil, biodiversity and land will affect agricultural systems. Sustainable agroecosystems are those tending to have a positive impact on natural, social and human capital, while unsustainable systems feed back to deplete these assets, leaving fewer for the future. Sustainable intensification (SI) is defined as a process or system where agricultural yields are increased without adverse environmental impact and without the conversion of additional non-agricultural land. The concept does not articulate or privilege any particular vision or method of agricultural production. Rather, it emphasizes ends rather than means, and does not pre-determine technologies, species mix or particular design components. The combination of the terms 'sustainable' and 'intensification' is an attempt to indicate that desirable outcomes around both more food and improved environmental goods and services could be achieved by a variety of means. Nonetheless, it remains controversial to some. • Scope and Conclusions This review analyses recent evidence of the impacts of SI in both developing and industrialized countries, and demonstrates that both yield and natural capital dividends can occur. The review begins with analysis of the emergence of combined agricultural'environmental systems, the environmental and social outcomes of recent agricultural revolutions, and analyses the challenges for food production this century as populations grow and consumption patterns change. Emergent criticisms are highlighted, and the positive impacts of SI on food outputs and renewable capital assets detailed. It concludes with observations on policies and incentives necessary for the wider adoption of SI, and indicates how SI could both promote transitions towards greener economies as well as benefit from progress in other sectors. © The Author 2014.},

This book gives a theoretical and practical demonstration of how ethics and technical considerations can aid the development of sustainability indexes to overcome this division in the literature and aid sustainability initiatives. Measuring and Evaluating Sustainability develops and illustrates methods of linking technical and normative concerns during the development of sustainability indexes. Specifically, guidelines for index development are combined with a pragmatic theory of ethics that enables ethical collaboration among people of diverse ethical systems. Using the resulting method of index development, the book takes a unique applied turn as it ethically evaluates multiple sustainability indexes developed and used by the European Commission, researchers, and local communities and suggests ways to improve the indexes. The book emphasizes justice as it is the most prevalent ethical principle in the sustainability literature and most neglected in index development. In addition to the ethical principles common to international sustainability initiatives, the book also employs a variety of religious and philosophical traditions to ensure that the ethical evaluations performed in the text align with the ideals of the communities using the indexes and foster cross-cultural ethical dialogue. This volume is an invaluable resource for students, researchers and professionals working on sustainability indicators and sustainability policy-making as well as interdisciplinary areas including environmental ethics; environmental philosophy; environmental or social justice; ecological economics; businesses sustainability programs; international development and environmental policy-making. © 2014 Sarah E.

	abstract = {Maritime shipping is highly fuel-efficient, but its sheer volume and rapid growth make it a major source of carbon emissions. Industry and governments seek to reduce the energy use and carbon footprint of shipping. Yet the reasons for the variation in shipping efficiency observed in the world fleet's embrace of best technical and operational practices to increase efficiency remain unexplained. The research reported in this paper offers a novel analysis that connected 2011 in-use fleet characteristics, first-ever global satellite data on ship movement, and technical literature on ship efficiency technology to assess the long-term prospects of increased shipping efficiency. This study also investigated how each ship characteristic influenced the efficiency of the shipping fleet. A ship stock turnover model was developed to track technical and operational efficiency practices in ships independently. The findings indicated that industry-leading ships were about twice as efficient as industry laggards across major ship types. If the available technical and in-use practices of the low-carbon industry leaders of today were fully embraced, the potential would exist to reduce carbon dioxide in absolute terms by more than 300 million metric tonnes by 2040, even while business-as-usual freight movement doubled. On the basis of the data in this assessment, the potential exists to develop a tool for shippers to quantify, evaluate, and compare their supply chain carbon footprints in a manner that does not rely on more aggregated fleet-average simplifications. The methodology, data, and findings of this study should benefit industry as it looks for ways to reduce energy consumption; researchers, who are examining ship operation; and policy makers, who want to curb the climate impact of international shipping.},

Can our cities be made more sustainable, and can environmental, economic and social collapse be staved off through changes in urban form and travel behaviour? How might rising indebtedness and the recent series of financial crises be related to automobile dependence and patterns of urban automobile use? To what extent does the system and economy of automobility factor in the production of urban socio-spatial inequalities, and how might these inequalities in mobility be understood and measured? What can we learn from the politics of mobility and social movements within cities? What is the role of automobility, and auto-dependence, in differentiating groups, both within cities and rural areas, and among transnational migrants moving across international borders? These are just some of the questions this book addresses. This volume provides a holistic and reflexive account of the role played by automobility in producing, reproducing, and differentiating social, economic and political life in the contemporary city, as well as the role played by the city in producing and reproducing auto-mobile inequalities. The first section, titled Driving Vulnerability, deals with issues of global importance related to economic, social, financial, and environmental sustainability and resilience, and socialization. The second section, Driving Inequality, is concerned with understanding the role played by automobility in producing urban socio-spatial inequalities, including those rooted in accessibility to work, migration status and ethnic concentration, and new measures of mobility-based inequality derived from the concept of effective speed. The third section, titled, Driving Politics, explores the politics of mobility in particular places, with an eye to demonstrating both the relevance of the politics of mobility for influencing and reinforcing actually existing neoliberalisms, and the kinds of politics that might allow for reform or restructuring of the auto-mobile city into one that is more socially, politically and environmentally just. In the conclusion to the book Walks draws on the findings of the other chapters to comment on the relationship between automobility, neoliberalism and citizenship, and to lay out strategies for dealing with the urban car system. © 2015 Alan Walks.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Point of Departure, Observations, and Projections The oceans cover about 71% of Earth’s surface to an average depth of 3700 m. Their importance for life on Earth, including humans, is vast (FAQ 6.1). Marine habitats display natural variability on various spatial and temporal scales but a dearth of long-term observational data from the vast open oceans limits our understanding of the causes and ecological consequences of this variability. The available information indicates that climate controls ocean temperatures, chemistry, circulation, upper ocean stratification, nutrient supply, and sunlight exposure. These drivers affect marine ecosystems through direct effects on organisms, amplified by their changing interactions with other species. Food webs are modified by changes in phytoplankton growth and the availability of live organisms or their decomposing bodies, that is, debris or dissolved organic matter, as food to (chemo-)heterotrophs (organisms gaining energy by feeding on organic matter). Organismal responses lead to changes in biogeochemical processes, such as the carbon cycle, and in biological diversity and the services the oceans provide. Some impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems and their services were addressed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4): WGII Chapters 4 to 6 (ecosystems, food, coastal areas), and regional chapters, for example, 15 (polar regions) and 16 (small islands). The ecosystem assessment in WGII AR4 Chapter 4 focused on terrestrial, coastal, and marine systems, their properties, goods, and services. It emphasized the difficulty in assessing future ecosystem responses as a result of ecosystem complexity, different vulnerabilities of species, and ecosystem-specific, critical thresholds associated with nonlinear responses to environmental change. Focusing on terrestrial ecosystems, WGII AR4 Chapter 4 concluded that more than 2°C to 3°C warming above preindustrial levels causes high extinction risks to 20 to 30% of present-day species (medium confidence), paralleled by substantial changes in ecosystem structure and functioning (high confidence). The authors projected that a wide range of planktonic and benthic calcifiers will be impacted by ocean warming (very high confidence) and acidification (medium confidence), particularly in the Southern Ocean. They characterized sea ice and coral reef biomes as highly vulnerable. © Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2014.},

	abstract = {The transfer of embodied exergy from one industry to another can be modeled using a network to help understand industrial characteristics and resource features of a specific area. In this paper, we build a weighted directed network of embodied exergy flows between Chinese industries based on the 135-sector input-output table from 2007. The density, connectedness and degree distribution are used to describe the overall performance of the network. The results show that the network has a low density and a high connectedness, indicating that the network has little influence on specific industries while individual industries have a strong impact on each other. The degree, weighted degree and betweenness centrality are used to determine the main industries in the network. Key industries are characterized by large degrees that play a key role in the network, of which the mining and washing of coal, the production and supply of electric and heat power, construction, and the rolling of steel have stronger influences on the network. Moreover, the production and supply of electric power and heat power, the manufacture of automobiles and farming are the intermediaries of the network. Finally, we use a block-modeling method to decompose the collection of 135 Chinese industries into seven communities. The community of coal-related industries is the core of the network, which transfers embodied exergy to every other community, whereas the community of steel-related industries is also important, forming the base of the rest of the network. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Specialists' insights have implications for formulating polices to manage global trade and shipping emissions. Established Delphi survey techniques achieved consensus in a novel long-term industrial context amongst international panelists with long-term industrial commitment, highlighting trends in drivers including Arctic ice melt, canal upgrades, piracy and mode splits. Globally, expected doubling of raw materials shipments to Western economies and quadrupling elsewhere will be partially offset by specialists' perceptions of shorter hauls. Moderate annual expected tonnage growth globally compares with rapid annual growth in coal shipments, although more localized and multi-sourcing will shorten global coal hauls. After 2030, ocean routing is expected to slightly shorten global hauls. Climate change brings both Arctic ice melt with shorter expected average hauls from Northeast Asia to Western Europe and longer hauls elsewhere as more droughts and failed states force ship re-routing to avoid piracy. Canal upgrades will offer shorter average hauls. Within the UK rising expected demand for biofuels and intolerance of fossil fuels will reduce shipping demand, inviting investigation of a systems approach to planning. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Driving a global explosion, it appears to stand in some relation to processes of globalization, but these links have mostly remained unexplored. This article revisits some established frameworks for understanding the connection between globalization and environmental degradation and argues that they are insufficient for explaining the Chinese explosion. A new hypothesis is outlined, called "the fossil capital hypothesis." It proposes that globally mobile capital will tend to relocate production to countries with cheap and disciplined labor, but only through the accelerated consumption of fossil energy. Via three specified "effects," the inflow of global capital will therefore set off massive increases in CO2 emissions. The hypothesis is applied in a brief analysis of developments in China between 2001 and 2008, and in other Asian countries after the Chinese strike wave in 2010. © The Author(s) 2012.},

	abstract = {The IPCC have identified a number of aspects of human activity that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and thereby affect climate change. These include such things as population size and patterns of land use that are difficult or impossible to change, especially in the short-term. However, they have also identified “lifestyle” as a major contributory factor. “Lifestyle” is comprised of many of the behavioural choices that we make as consumers in our everyday lives. This makes a deeper understanding of consumer choice a critical consideration in the fight against climate change. One important theoretical issue, deriving from an evolutionary perspective, is how the presence of others affects consumer choice with differing environmental consequences. In this study, we compared the product choices of a set of experimental participants when shopping alone or with friends in a simulated shopping task. We found that the presence of others had a significant effect overall on consumer choice. People are more likely to select well-known brands and luxury products when shopping with others. Costly signalling theory (from evolutionary psychology), where we signal to our friends that we have the resource to purchase these kinds of items, can explain these findings. Similarly, we found that people are more likely to purchase organic or eco brands when shopping with others. Again, this is compatible with costly signalling theory, where we signal here our pro-social orientation through our selections (this is also advantageous in evolutionary terms). However, carbon footprint labels did not work in this way. Our participants were significantly more likely to choose low-carbon items when shopping alone than when shopping with friends. In other words, low-carbon items did not behave like well-known brands, luxury items, or organic/eco products. There appears to be no added social cachet to choosing low-carbon products in public, and this raises significant concerns about whether carbon labelling can genuinely work as an enabling factor. We make some suggestions about how we might raise the recognition value of carbon labels. © Common Ground, Laura McGuire and Geoffrey Beattie, All Rights Reserved.},

Presented in three parts with 60 contributions written by expert international researchers, this text addresses the central ideas through which human geographers understand and shape their subject. Part I: Foundations engages students with key ideas that define human geography’s subject matter and approaches, through critical analyses of dualisms such as local-global, society-space and human-nonhuman. Part II: Themes explores human geography’s main sub-disciplines, with sections devoted to biogeographies, cartographies, cultural geographies, development geographies, economic geographies, environmental geographies, historical geographies, political geographies, population geographies, social geographies, urban and rural geographies. Finally, Part III: Horizons assesses the latest research in innovative areas, from mobilities and securities to non-representational geographies.

Specifically we look in depth at the Tyne and Wear Metro system, situated in Newcastle upon Tyne, to determine if such a scheme would be feasible. Through research into the modes of transport available, along with a review of literature and case studies, it was found that the current method of transporting the majority of freight by road is unsustainable and damaging to both the environment and local communities. Other options for the transportation of freight have been reviewed, and results showed that a modal shift will be necessary in the near future. The system was then modelled using software provided by the Department for Transport, which demonstrated that the implementation of such a scheme would provide vast accident savings, a reduction in the number of casualties on the road, and a monetary saving as a result of the lower casualty rate. The conclusion was reached that the scheme is viable; however, further research and study are necessary before implementation. © 2015, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {By 2050 the world's population is projected to grow by one-third, reaching between 9 and 10 billion. With globalization and expected growth in global affluence, a substantial increase in per capita meat, dairy, and fish consumption is also anticipated. The demand for calories from animal products will nearly double, highlighting the critical importance of the world's animal agriculture system. Meeting the nutritional needs of this population and its demand for animal products will require a significant investment of resources as well as policy changes that are supportive of agricultural production. Ensuring sustainable agricultural growth will be essential to addressing this global challenge to food security. Critical Role of Animal Science Research in Food Security and Sustainability identifies areas of research and development, technology, and resource needs for research in the field of animal agriculture, both nationally and internationally. This report assesses the global demand for products of animal origin in 2050 within the framework of ensuring global food security; evaluates how climate change and natural resource constraints may impact the ability to meet future global demand for animal products in sustainable production systems; and identifies factors that may impact the ability of the United States to meet demand for animal products, including the need for trained human capital, product safety and quality, and effective communication and adoption of new knowledge, information, and technologies. The agricultural sector worldwide faces numerous daunting challenges that will require innovations, new technologies, and new ways of approaching agriculture if the food, feed, and fiber needs of the global population are to be met. The recommendations of Critical Role of Animal Science Research in Food Security and Sustainability will inform a new roadmap for animal science research to meet the challenges of sustainable animal production in the 21st century. © 2015 by the National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {The green economy is widely seen as a potential solution to current global economic and environmental crises, and a potential mechanism by which sustainable development might be achieved in practice. Considerable investments are now being made into the development of green technology, renewable energy, biodiversity conservation, resource efficiency, recycling of materials and green infrastructure. This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the green economy, using a strongly interdisciplinary approach based on environmental science, rather than treating it as a sub-set of economics. The scientific principles of sustainability are presented, which provide the foundations of the green economy, with a particular focus on systems-based approaches. Examples of real-world case studies are used to illustrate how the green economy can be achieved in practice. In this way, the authors provide a thorough overview of both the principles and practice of the green economy, drawing from a wide range of disciplines including ecology, geography, social science, psychology, sustainability science, environmental science, law and economics. The emphasis is on presenting results of the latest research, derived from leading scientific journals. Rather than focusing on a single definition of what constitutes a ‘green economy’, the book introduces readers to the diversity of opinion that exists, and engages them in what is an active, on-going debate. This reflects the fact that many aspects of the green economy, and sustainable development more generally, are currently contested. In particular, the book will help readers to strengthen their ability to critically evaluate the evidence for and against the views presented, and to actively contribute to the future development of the green economy. © 2014 Adrian C.

We have already seen evidence of the fallout associated with ecological overconsumption and continued abuse of environmental systems will create increasing challenges both today and into the future. Our depletion of natural systems minimizes the possibilities available to future generations who are expected to somehow rely on innovation and ingenuity for their survival. Yet, despite the challenges we face, governments, individuals, non-profits, educational institutions, and corporations are all heralding the promise of sustainable development to save our environmental systems from collapse while allowing for uninterrupted economic growth. Today, the concept of sustainability is a widespread goal that nearly everyone supports. At the same time, almost no one means the same thing when they use the term. Sustainability is so broad and overly used that it seems to mean everything to everyone. The result is that the concept has lost its meaning. In this book, the authors examine the misuses and abuses of "sustainability" and seek to refine and clarify the concept. The authors offer a new definition of sustainability – what they call neo-sustainability – to help guide policies and practices that respect the primacy of the environment, the natural limits of the environment, and the relationship between environmental, social, and economic systems. © 2014 Heather M.

	abstract = {Few concerns preoccupy contemporary progressive thought as much as the issue of how to achieve a sustainable human society. The problems impeding this goal include those of how to arrest induced global environmental change (GEC), persistent disagreements about the contribution of economic activities to GEC and further differences in views on how these activities can be reformed in order to reduce the rate of change and thus to mitigate threats to much life on Earth. Reforming Law and Economy for a Sustainable Earth aims to help resolve these problems in two ways. Since addressing GEC will require global coordination, the book first clarifies the conditions necessary to achieve this effectively. Paul Anderson explores these conditions with the aid of a sustained analysis of key concepts in influential disciplines, particularly in social and political theory and law, relating to the transition to a sustainable economy. Second, Anderson tackles the problem of how to arrest GEC by incisively evaluating two leading theoretical positions in terms of their capacity to support the conditions required for effective global coordination. From this basis, the book offers an extensive critique of the idea that global environmental problems can be solved within the framework of global capitalism. It also critically reviews and advances the proposition that global sustainability can be achieved only by changing the capitalist form of organizing the economy. Enriched by a genuinely interdisciplinary approach, the originality of Reforming Law and Economy for a Sustainable Earth lies in the manner it combines a rigorous analysis of the requirements for global sustainability with decisive conclusions as to what are, and what are not, viable means of fulfilling those requirements. The book advances research on sustainability within key disciplines, among them political theory, law and social science, by offering a timely and insightful statement about the global environmental predicament in the 21st century. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Social Marketing is the utilisation of marketing principles and methods to encourage individual and organisational behaviour change for the public good. Traditionally the domain of government it is increasingly also utilised by non-government and non-profit organisations and other institutions of civil society as a non-regulatory means to achieve policy and public good goals. At a time when concerns over tourism’s contribution to undesirable environmental, economic and social change is greater than ever, social marketing strategies are important for encouraging more appropriate and desirable behaviours by tourists and the tourism industry. Tourism and Social Marketing is the first book to comprehensively detail the relevance of social marketing principles and practice to tourism, destination management and marketing. By considering this relationship and application of social marketing approaches to key issues facing contemporary tourism development, such as the environment, this book provides significant insights into how the behaviours of visitors and businesses may be changed so as to develop more sustainable forms of tourism and improve the quality of life of destination communities. It further provides a powerful impetus to the development of tourism related forms of sustainable consumption and the promotion of ethical tourism and marketing. This innovative book is comprehensive in scope by considering a variety of relevant fields relevant to tourism and social marketing practice including, health, non - profit organisations, governance, the politics of marketing and consumption, consumer advocacy and environmental and sustainable marketing. It integrates selected international cases studies to help tourism students engage with the broader debates in social marketing, governance and the politics of behaviour change and shows the relationship of theory to practice. Written by a leading authority in the field, topical and integrative, this book will be valuable reading for students, scholars and researchers in tourism. © 2014 C. Michael Hall.},

	abstract = {Feeding the world population, 7.3 billion in 2015 and projected to increase to 9.5 billion by 2050, necessitates an increase in agricultural production of ~70% between 2005 and 2050. Soil degradation, characterized by decline in quality and decrease in ecosystem goods and services, is a major constraint to achieving the required increase in agricultural production. Soil is a non-renewable resource on human time scales with its vulnerability to degradation depending on complex interactions between processes, factors and causes occurring at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Among the major soil degradation processes are accelerated erosion, depletion of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool and loss in biodiversity, loss of soil fertility and elemental imbalance, acidification and salinization. Soil degradation trends can be reversed by conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended management practices. The strategy is to minimize soil erosion, create positive SOC and N budgets, enhance activity and species diversity of soil biota (micro, meso, and macro), and improve structural stability and pore geometry. Improving soil quality (i.e., increasing SOC pool, improving soil structure, enhancing soil fertility) can reduce risks of soil degradation (physical, chemical, biological and ecological) while improving the environment. Increasing the SOC pool to above the critical level (10 to 15 g/kg) is essential to set-in-motion the restorative trends. Site-specific techniques of restoring soil quality include conservation agriculture, integrated nutrient management, continuous vegetative cover such as residue mulch and cover cropping, and controlled grazing at appropriate stocking rates. The strategy is to produce "more from less" by reducing losses and increasing soil, water, and nutrient use efficiency. © 2015 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Petroleum fuels remain the dominant energy source, reflecting advantages such as high energy density, low cost, and market availability. The movement of people and freight makes a major contribution to economic development and social well-being, but it also negatively impacts climate change, air quality, health, social cohesion, and safety. Following a review published 20 years ago in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources (then named the Annual Review of Energy and the Environment) by Lee Schipper, we examine current trends and potential futures, revising several major global transport/energy reports. There are significant opportunities to slow travel growth and improve efficiency. Alternatives to petroleum exist but have different characteristics in terms of availability, cost, distribution, infrastructure, storage, and public acceptability. The transition to low-carbon equitable and sustainable transport will take time but can be fostered by numerous short- and medium-term strategies that would benefit energy security, health, productivity, and sustainability.

	abstract = {In the last few years Circular Economy (CE) is receiving increasing attention worldwide as a way to overcome the current production and consumption model based on continuous growth and increasing resource throughput. By promoting the adoption of closing-the-loop production patterns within an economic system CE aims to increase the efficiency of resource use, with special focus on urban and industrial waste, to achieve a better balance and harmony between economy, environment and society. This study provides an extensive review of the literature of last two decades, with the purpose of grasping the main CE features and perspectives: origins, basic principles, advantages and disadvantages, modelling and implementation of CE at the different levels (micro, meso and macro) worldwide. Results evidence that CE origins are mainly rooted in ecological and environmental economics and industrial ecology. In China CE is promoted as a top-down national political objective while in other areas and countries as European Union, Japan and USA it is a tool to design bottom-up environmental and waste management policies. The ultimate goal of promoting CE is the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth. The implementation of CE worldwide still seems in the early stages, mainly focused on recycle rather than reuse. Important results have been achieved in some activity sectors (e.g. in waste management, where large waste recycling rates are achieved in selected developed countries). CE implies the adoption of cleaner production patterns at company level, an increase of producers and consumers responsibility and awareness, the use of renewable technologies and materials (wherever possible) as well as the adoption of suitable, clear and stable policies and tools. The lesson learned from successful experiences is that the transition towards CE comes from the involvement of all actors of the society and their capacity to link and create suitable collaboration and exchange patterns. Success stories also point out the need for an economic return on investment, in order to provide suitable motivation to companies and investors. In summary, the CE transition has just started. Moreover, the interdisciplinary framework underpinning CE offers good prospects for gradual improvement of the present production and consumption models, no longer adequate because of their environmental load and social inequity, a clear indicator of resource use inefficiency. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The volume introduces original contributions to the debates on peak oil, land grabbing and social alternatives, thus creating a synthesis to gain an overview of the multiple crises of our times.; The book sets out to analyse how crises of energy, climate, metals, minerals and the soil relate to the global land grab which has accelerated greatly since 2008, as well as to examine the crisis of profit production and political legitimacy. Based on a theoretical understanding of the multiple crises and the effects of peak oil and other scarcities on capital accumulation, the contributors explore the social innovations that provide an alternative.; Using the most up to date research on resource crises, this integrative and critical analysis brings together the issues with a radical perspective on possibilites for future change as well as a strong social economic and ethical dimesion. The book should be of interest to researchers and students of environmental policy, politics, sustainable development and natural resource management. © 2013 Andreas Exner, Peter Fleissner, Lukas Kranzl and Werner Zittel.},

	abstract = {The aim of this book is to review central concepts in the study of environmental politics and to open up new questions, problems, and research agendas in the field.; The volume does so by drawing on a wide range of approaches from critical theory to poststructuralism, and spanning disciplines including international relations, geography, sociology, history, philosophy, anthropology, and political science. The 28 chapters cover a range of global and local studies, illustrations and cases. These range from the Cochabamba conference in Bolivia to climate camps in the UK; UN summits in Rio de Janeiro and Johannesburg to climate migrants from Pacific islands; forests in Indonesia to Dutch energy governance reform; indigenous communities in Namibia to oil extraction in the Niger Delta; survivalist militias in the USA to Maasai tribesmen in Kenya.; Rather than following a regional or issue-based (e.g. water, forests, pollution, etc) structure, the volume is organised in terms of key concepts in the field, including those which have been central to the social sciences for a long time (such as citizenship, commodification, consumption, feminism, justice, movements, science, security, the state, summits, and technology); those which have been at the heart of environmental politics for many years (including biodiversity, climate change, conservation, eco-centrism, limits, localism, resources, sacrifice, and sustainability); and many which have been introduced to these literatures and debates more recently (biopolitics, governance, governmentality, hybridity, posthumanism, risk, and vulnerability).; Features and benefits of the book:; • Explains the most important concepts and theories in environmental politics.; • Reviews the core ideas behind crucial debates in environmental politics.; • Highlights the key thinkers – both classic and contemporary – for studying environmental politics.; • Provides original perspectives on the critical potential of the concepts for future research agendas as well as for the practice of environmental politics.; Each chapter is written by leading international authors in their field.; This exciting new volume will be essential textbook reading for all students of environmental politics, as well as provocatively presenting the field in a different light for more established researchers. © 2014 Carl Death, selection and editorial matter.},

	abstract = {Today, global land use is affected by a variety of factors, including urbanization and the growing interconnectedness of economies and markets. This book examines the challenges and opportunities we face in achieving sustainable land use in the twenty-first century. While land resources remain finite, the global population is projected to reach ten billion by the end of the century, bringing issues of ethics and fairness to center stage. Who should decide how land is used? Where does competition for land occur, and why? Moreover, accelerating globalization, increasing demand for animal protein in our diets, the need for new sources of energy, and the global scarcity of land have led to a decoupling of land use and local control, which raises issues of governance. The contributors, from a range of disciplines and countries, present new analytical perspectives and tools for understanding key issues in global land use. The chapters consider such topics as food production and land use; case studies of urbanization and agriculture in Brazil and China; telecoupling and connections to distant places; emerging institutions of land-use governance; public and private regulation of land use; uniquely urban issues of land use; and future steps to sustainability.

	abstract = {The freight infrastructure network (e.g., roads, railways, waterways, etc.) is the backbone of nearly all trade partnerships in the United States and abroad. The manner in which the individual portions of its constituent parts are interrelated or arranged plays an important role for determining the environmental footprint of goods moved within the network. Herein, we compare the spatial distribution of potential consumer-producer exchanges (i.e., accessibility) under varying greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets or preferences for minimal transportation-related GHG emissions. We conduct case studies using two freight modes (truck and intermodal rail) for two representative commodities: meat/seafood and paper articles. Results across all counties in the United States indicate that the geographic area in which trade is possible, given a GHG budget, varies by transportation mode, location, and commodity. Our results suggest that intermodal terminal availability is an important determinant of low-GHG accessibility. Since only a fraction of road-to-rail terminals accommodate meat/seafood (4.9%) and paper (0.7%), the United States could increase its expected GHG savings associated with truck-to-rail mode-switching policies by 70% (+20 kg CO2,e/ton for meat/seafood) and 310% (+30 kg CO2,e/ton for paper) by upgrading current terminals to allow the exchange of all types of goods. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

Though there has been much enthusiasm from political and environmental groups, the underlying economics and politics remain highly controversial. This book takes a cool-headed look at the critical roadblocks to agreement, examining the economics of climate change, the incentives of the main players (the United States, EU, China), and the policies which governments can put in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and ultimately shift our economies onto a low-carbon path. It questions the basis of much of the climate change consensus and debates the Stern Review's main findings. Aside from a reassessment of the economics of climate change, the book looks at the geography of the costs and benefits of climate change - the very different perspectives of Africa, China, Europe, and the United States - as well as the prospects for a new global agreement. It also considers policy instruments at the global level (whereas much of the literature to date is nationally and regionally based). Trading and R&D, along with more radical unilateral options, including geoengineering, are discussed. Finally, the book describes the institutional architecture - drawing on evidence from previous attempts in other areas, as well as proposals for new bodies. © Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 2009.

Municipal level institutions design and implement sustainability action plans, climate action plans and increasingly, climate adaption projects. This article reviews the debates surrounding the role of institutions in sustainable urban governance, as well as the tools available to assess the plurality of actors working within and across institutional boundaries. Sustainability as a guiding principle in urban planning requires a fundamental reorientation of the rationalities that have governed discrete aspects of social, economic and political life in cities. Institutions, in ordering the administrative and management activities of urban governments, are critical in efforts to hasten the adoption of sustainability ideals and in the implementation of associated projects. Urban political institutions engage with new forms of environmental leadership and polycentric forms of environmental governance in response to contextually specific urban characteristics and actor constellations. The extent to which sustainability ideals are institutionalized depends on sound analysis that helps form new understandings of the ways in which human-environment systems are coupled — and how this coupling should inform governance action in support of sustainable urban development. © 2017 The Author.

But what are the prospects for reconciling the two, and how far have we come with this project? This book explores these questions through a detailed consideration of the past, present and future of the relationship between conservation and development. Bringing to bear conceptual resources from political ecology, social-ecological systems thinking and science and technology studies, Conservation and Development sets this relationship against the background of the political and economic processes implicated in environmental degradation and poverty alike. Whilst recognising that the need for reconciling conservation and development processes remains as compelling as ever, it demonstrates why trade-offs are more frequently encountered in practice than synergies. It also flags alternative visions for conservation and development obscured or ignored by current framings and priorities. Bringing together policy and theory, Conservation and Development is an essential resource for undergraduate and postgraduate students and a useful reference for researchers in related fields. Each chapter contains a reading guide with discussion questions. The text is enlivened by a number of new case studies from around the world. A must-read for anyone interested in understanding the history, current state, and projections for future shifts in the relationship between conservation and development. © 2016 Andrew Newsham and Shonil Bhagwat.

	abstract = {Meat eating is often a contentious subject, whether considering the technical, ethical, environmental, political, or health-related aspects of production and consumption. This book is a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary examination and critique of meat consumption by humans, throughout their evolution and around the world. Setting the scene with a chapter on meat's role in human evolution and its growing influence during the development of agricultural practices, the book goes on to examine modern production systems, their efficiencies, outputs, and impacts. The major global trends of meat consumption are described in order to find out what part its consumption plays in changing modern diets in countries around the world. The heart of the book addresses the consequences of the "massive carnivory" of western diets, looking at the inefficiencies of production and at the huge impacts on land, water, and the atmosphere. Health impacts are also covered, both positive and negative. In conclusion, the author looks forward at his vision of "rational meat eating", where environmental and health impacts are reduced, animals are treated more humanely, and alternative sources of protein make a higher contribution. Should We Eat Meat? is not an ideological tract for or against carnivorousness but rather a careful evaluation of meat's roles in human diets and the environmental and health consequences of its production and consumption. It will be of interest to a wide readership including professionals and academics in food and agricultural production, human health and nutrition, environmental science, and regulatory and policy making bodies around the world. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Topics such as the global hunger and obesity challenges, GM foods, and international trade and subsidies are assessed as part of the world food economy. The final section concentrates on themes of sustainability, food security, and food sovereignty. The book concludes on a positive note, examining alternative agri-food movements aimed at changing foodscapes at levels from the local to the global. With increased coverage of the financialization of food, food and culture, gender, ethnicity and justice, food security, and food sovereignty, the book is perfect for students with little or no background in sociology and is also suitable for more advanced courses as a comprehensive primer.

Three key concerns are examined from a North-South perspective: ecological issues (related to land use and biodiversity), pro-poor policies (related to food and land security, gender and income generation) and equity of benefits within the global value chain. Can biofuels be pro-poor? Can smallholder farmers be equitably integrated in the biofuels global supply chain? Is the biofuels production chain detrimental to biodiversity? Most other books available on biofuels take a technical approach and are aimed at addressing energy security or climate change issues. This title focuses on the socio-economic impacts on rural people's livelihoods, offering a unique perspective on the potential role of biofuels in reducing rural poverty. © 2013 Joy Clancy.

	abstract = {Food is increasingly traded internationally, thereby transforming the organization of food production and consumption globally and influencing most food-related practices. This transition is generating unfamiliar challenges related to sustainability of food provision, the social impacts of international trade and global food governance. Distance in time and space between food producers and consumers is increasing and new concerns are arising. These include the environmental impact of food production and trade, animal welfare, the health and safety of food and the social and economic impact of international food trade. This book provides an overview of the principal conceptual frameworks that have been developed for understanding these changes. It shows how conventional regulation of food provision through sovereign national governments is becoming elusive, as the distinctions between domestic and international, and between public and private spheres, disappear. At the same time multi-national companies and supranational institutions put serious limits to governmental interventions. In this context, other social actors including food retailers and NGOs are shown to take up innovative roles in governing food provision, but their contribution to agro-food sustainability is under continuous scrutiny. The authors apply these themes in several detailed case studies, including organic, fair trade, local food and fish. On the basis of these cases, future developments are explored, with a focus on the respective roles of agricultural producers, retailers and consumers. © 2012 Peter Oosterveer and David A.

	abstract = {The movement of retail goods is central to modern economies and is a significant-but understudied-fraction of our overall energy footprint. Thus, we propose a new category for energy analysis called Retail Goods Movement (RGM) that draws its boundaries around the portion of freight dedicated to retail goods and the portion of driving dedicated to shopping. Historically, the components of RGM have not enjoyed policy priority. However, the net payoff from energy research and policy directed at RGM may now be high enough relative to other options to deserve increased investment. We combine a quantitative decomposition of the dynamics of RGM energy use with a qualitative discussion of what trends could have contributed to them. The RGM sectors energy use grew from 1.3 EJ (2.8% U.S.) in 1969 to 7.0 EJ (6.6% U.S.) in 2009. The major drivers were increases in population, freight tonnage (before 1990), distance freighted per tonne and driven per shopping trip (after 1990), and weekly shopping trips per household (before 1995). RGM energy intensity increased per capita (180%), per constant dollar GDP (60%), and per retail expenditure (140%). Finally, we describe policy recommendations that could become the basis of a sound RGM resource plan. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

The idea that outdoor air pollution can cause exacerbations of pre-existing asthma is supported by an evidence base that has been accumulating for several decades, with several studies suggesting a contribution to new-onset asthma as well. In this Series paper, we discuss the effects of particulate matter (PM), gaseous pollutants (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide), and mixed traffi c-related air pollution. We focus on clinical studies, both epidemiological and experimental, published in the previous 5 years. From a mechanistic perspective, air pollutants probably cause oxidative injury to the airways, leading to infl ammation, remodelling, and increased risk of sensitisation. Although several pollutants have been linked to new-onset asthma, the strength of the evidence is variable. We also discuss clinical implications, policy issues, and research gaps relevant to air pollution and asthma.},

	abstract = {The mentality that consumerism and economic growth are cure-alls is one of the biggest obstacles to real sustainability, but any change seems impossible, unthinkable. Our contemporary paradox finds us relying for our well being on consumer-driven economic growth that we actually can’t afford — not in environmental, economic or social terms. Although architecture and design have long been seen as engines for consumerism and growth, increasing numbers of designers are concerned about the problems resulting from growth. But designers face a paradox of their own; in scenarios of sustainable consumption, where people consume or build significantly less, what will be left for designers to do? This book, informed by recent research into the viability of a "steady state" economy, sets an agenda for addressing the designer’s paradox of sustainable consumption. The agenda includes ways that architecture and design can help transition us towards a new kind of economy that prioritizes real wellbeing rather than economic growth. Packed with examples and illustrations, the book argues that taking action, or activism, is an important but so far underexplored way for architects and designers to confront consumerism. The first chapters explore how economic growth and consumerism shape and are shaped by the professions of architecture, product, and landscape design and how we can understand the problem of consumerism as four main challenges that designers are already addressing. The book maps out the main issues surrounding the development of metrics that designers and others can use to measure wellbeing, instead of simply measuring economic growth. The second half of the book looks at how design activism works and its connection to growth and consumerist issues. These chapters examine how activist practices are financed, highlight five specific methods that designers use in working for social change, and investigate the power of these methods. The book concludes with a consideration of what design’s role might be in a "post-growth" society. © 2012 Ann Thorpe. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In an era where humans affect virtually all of the earth's processes, questions arise about whether we have sufficient knowledge of human-environment interactions. How can we sustain the Earth's ecosystems to prevent collapses and what roles should practitioners and scientists play in this process? These are the issues central to the concept of environmental literacy. This unique book provides a comprehensive review and analysis of environmental literacy within the context of environmental science and sustainable development. Approaching the topic from multiple perspectives, it explores the development of human understanding of the environment and human-environment interactions in the fields of biology, psychology, sociology, economics and industrial ecology. The discussion emphasises the importance of knowledge integration and transdisciplinary processes as key strategies for understanding complex human-environment systems (HES). In addition, the author defines the HES framework as a template for investigating sustainably coupled human-environment systems in the 21st century. © R. W. Scholz 2011.},

	abstract = {In the nearly 10 years since the publication of the bestselling first edition of Introduction to Green Chemistry, interest in green chemistry and clean processes has grown so much that topics, such as fluorous biphasic catalysis, metal organic frameworks, and process intensification, barely mentioned in the first edition, have become major areas of research. In addition, government funding has ramped up the development of fuel cells and biofuels. It reflects the evolving focus from pollution remediation to pollution prevention. Copiously illustrated with over 800 figures, this second edition provides an update from the frontiers of the field. New and expanded research topics: • Metal-organic frameworks • Solid acids for alkylation of isobutene by butanes • Carbon molecular sieves • Mixed micro- and mesoporous solids • Organocatalysis • Process intensification and gas phase enzymatic reactions • Hydrogen storage for fuel cells • Reactive distillation • Catalysts in action on an atomic scale Updated and expanded current events topics: • Industry resistance to inherently safer chemistry • Nuclear power • Removal of mercury from vaccines • Removal of mercury and lead from primary explosives • Biofuels • Uses for surplus glycerol • New hard materials to reduce wear • Electronic waste • Smart growth The book covers traditional green chemistry topics, including catalysis, benign solvents, and alternative feedstocks. It also discusses relevant but less frequently covered topics with chapters such as Chemistry of Longer Wear and Population and the Environment. This coverage highlights the importance of chemistry to everyday life and demonstrates the benefits the expanded exploitation of green chemistry can have for society. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Evidence shows that, even after two centuries, technological advances due to the industrial revolution have not touched the life of each and every human life equally. The history of development and the GHG emission load have triggered the sufferer-polluter debate. In the past few decades the 'polluter pays principle' has provided neither a substantial transfer of wealth to those suffering from the effects of pollution nor a reduction in global emissions. In a carbon-constrained world there is an immediate need to free up some space through emission reduction from conspicuous consumption to accommodate survival emission. Lifestyle change is a complementary call for a continuous effort encompassing spread of awareness of sustainable lifestyles, energy concerns, building of synergies between policy, regulation, technology, market forces and ethical imperatives. The focus of change needs to be on patterns of energy consumption. It is important to include this in the global policy discourse.

	abstract = {Building on structuralist perspectives of the world economy, a small but growing group of researchers have forged a new literature on 'ecologically unequal exchange' and documented that energy and materials disproportionately flow from the Global South to the Global North. These findings have begun to influence efforts to negotiate a 'post-Kyoto' global climate regime. Since the extraction of resources and energy is one of the most damaging stages of the chain of commodity production, a logical next step is the mounting cry from developing countries that they are owed an 'ecological debt' by the North. The G-77 and China have seized on these ideas and a movement for 'climate justice' is now gaining strength in and exerting influence in international negotiations, including the UNFCCC meetings in Delhi, Bali, and Poznań. This article reviews the history of these related three ideas and examines their potential to reshape the discussion of 'burden sharing' in the post-Kyoto world where development is constrained by climate change. © The Author(s), 2009.},

	abstract = {Climate change is occurring, is caused largely by human activities, and poses significant risks for--and in many cases is already affecting--a broad range of human and natural systems. The compelling case for these conclusions is provided in Advancing the Science of Climate Change, part of a congressionally requested suite of studies known as America's Climate Choices. While noting that there is always more to learn and that the scientific process is never closed, the book shows that hypotheses about climate change are supported by multiple lines of evidence and have stood firm in the face of serious debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. As decision makers respond to these risks, the nation's scientific enterprise can contribute through research that improves understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change and also is useful to decision makers at the local, regional, national, and international levels. The book identifies decisions being made in 12 sectors, ranging from agriculture to transportation, to identify decisions being made in response to climate change. Advancing the Science of Climate Change calls for a single federal entity or program to coordinate a national, multidisciplinary research effort aimed at improving both understanding and responses to climate change. Seven cross-cutting research themes are identified to support this scientific enterprise. In addition, leaders of federal climate research should redouble efforts to deploy a comprehensive climate observing system, improve climate models and other analytical tools, invest in human capital, and improve linkages between research and decisions by forming partnerships with action-oriented programs. © 2011 by the National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {In the United States, we have come to depend on plentiful and inexpensive energy to support our economy and lifestyles. In recent years, many questions have been raised regarding the sustainability of our current pattern of high consumption of nonrenewable energy and its environmental consequences. Further, because the United States imports about 55 percent of the nation's consumption of crude oil, there are additional concerns about the security of supply. Hence, efforts are being made to find alternatives to our current pathway, including greater energy efficiency and use of energy sources that could lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such as nuclear and renewable sources, including solar, wind, geothermal, and biofuels. The United States has a long history with biofuels and the nation is on a course charted to achieve a substantial increase in biofuels. Renewable Fuel Standard evaluates the economic and environmental consequences of increasing biofuels production as a result of Renewable Fuels Standard, as amended by EISA (RFS2). The report describes biofuels produced in 2010 and those projected to be produced and consumed by 2022, reviews model projections and other estimates of the relative impact on the prices of land, and discusses the potential environmental harm and benefits of biofuels production and the barriers to achieving the RFS2 consumption mandate. Policy makers, investors, leaders in the transportation sector, and others with concerns for the environment, economy, and energy security can rely on the recommendations provided in this report. © 2011 by the National Academy of Sciences.

In urban areas, additional concerns are air pollution, traffic congestion, take-up of land by transport infrastructure, and quality of urban life. Similarly, a variety of technological approaches are possible for addressing these problems in the context of global warming mitigation. This chapter examines policies for mobility reduction, as these can have a significant impact on climate change mitigation.

Danny Harvey sets out in unprecedented detail the path we must take to minimize the effects that the way we harness energy will have on future climate change. The book opens by highlighting the importance of moving to low carbon technologies for generation, then moves on to explain the functioning, potential and social/environmental issues around: • solar energy • wind energy • biomass energy • geothermal energy • hydroelectric power • ocean energy • nuclear energy. It also covers the options for carbon capture and storage and the contexts in which low carbon energy can best be utilized (potential for community integrated systems, and the hydrogen economy). The book closes with scenarios that combine the findings from its companion volume (concerning the potential for limiting future energy demand) with the findings from this volume (concerning the cost and potential of C-free energy systems) to generate scenarios that succeed in limiting future atmospheric CO2 concentration to no more than 450 ppmv.

	abstract = {Global Environmental Issues, second edition builds on the popularity of the first edition, viewing global environmental problems as complex issues with a network of causes, influenced by a range of actors with differing priorities. The book recognises that science underpins much of what happens in society and therefore it is important to be able to interpret the environmental and social consequences of scientific developments. In addition to discussing the main biophysical causes, the book illustrates how socio-economic and political factors determine why and how people use land, resources and technology, and how this in turn affects natural resource management. This edition includes new chapters on the politics of science, International environmental regulation and treaties, environmental issues in a globalised world and natural resource management. Global Environmental Issues, second edition is essential reading for upper level undergraduates and Masters students within departments of Environmental Science and Geography. Includes case studies from around the world to provide a real life context for the issues tackled in each chapter. Considers both the results of human actions and natural environmental change in order to provide balanced, in-depth debate. Includes coverage of contemporary 'hot topics' such as biodiversity, globalization and sustainable development. Chapters authored by experts in the field. Includes new chapters on The politics of science, International environmental regulation and treaties, Environmental issues in a globalised world and Natural Resource Management. Expanded sections include negotiating multilateral environmental agreements, GM crops, biofuels and marine and freshwater resources. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The reality of the climatic changes that the planet is going through is unequivocal, and so is the human influence in this process. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations predicts substantial climatic changes for the Neotropical region. In fact, the impact of these climatic changes over the region's biodiversity is already being felt: collapse of coral ecosystems in the Caribbean, glaciers retraction in the andes, and extreme drought events in the amazon. although there is a substantial body of knowledge about the possible impacts of climate change over the Brazilian forest formations, especially in the amazon, studies about the impacts on elements of the countries' biodiversity are virtually inexistent. In the last 20 years only two scientific papers were published in indexed journals within the Thompson Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) database. This knowledge gap prevents the elaboration of any adaptation strategy aiming at the conservation of biodiversity in Brazil. The scientific community and funding agencies, therefore, must start prioritizing that brand of studies. Brazil, however, should not concentrate only on adaptation strategies, because there already is a great potential for mitigation of the ongoing climatic changes. Despite of its relatively clean energetic network, the country is among the World's greatest emitters of greenhouse gases because of the enormous emissions associated with deforestation. A first order issue is the countries' historical opposition to the incorporation of 'avoided deforestation' as one of the Clean Development Mechanisms within the Kyoto Protocol. An active participation of the scientific community linked to conservation this debate is paramount, as it has serious consequences for biodiversity conservation in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Environmental harm is commonly associated with the front-line companies that most visibly consume and pollute our shared natural resources. Rarely are the "unseen polluters", the financial institutions that fund and profit from eco-damaging corporations put at the forefront of the environmental debate. By focusing on these unseen polluters, this book provides a comprehensive examination of the response of the movement for socially responsible investment (SRI) and its current regulation worldwide. It finds that in recent years SRI has shifted away from its traditions of ethical investment to a business case approach, whereby social and environmental issues are addressed largely only if they are perceived as "financial material" to investors. Further, the contemporary SRI movement lacks sufficient influence in financial markets to provide a viable framework of governance to offset the deficiencies and gaps in official regulation. In offering a guide to possible reform to ensure that the financial sector prioritizes ethically-based investments, this book proposes greater regulatory supervision of SRI. It suggests that new governmental reforms should provide financiers with a better mix of economic incentives and informational resources. More importantly, it also argues for redefining the fiduciary responsibilities of institutional investors to incorporate environmental concern. Through these and other measures, the book posits that corporate financiers, including banks, mutual funds and pension plans, will be more accountable to the goals of achieving environmentally sustainable development. © 2008 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

	abstract = {Transforming Urban Transport confronts head-on the dilemma faced by a world wedded to mobility: the danger of continuing along the fossil-fuelled path and the real paucity of viable technological alternatives that can be deployed in time. To respond to the dilemma, the ideal of urban transport must be changed from auto-based mobility to systems of sustainable transport in which public transport and non-motorized transport work together to reduce climate change pressures, enhance urban quality and preserve life and health. The book challenges the commonly held view that a combination of urbanity and higher residential density expressed in compact cities - expected to have greater public transport use - will resolve urban transport/ environment problems, instead showing that transport systems can be changed to meet the environmental imperatives without the massive spatial change implied in that commonly cited approach. But the problem of change of urban transport is profoundly institutional and cultural. Changes in urban mobility and transport require local institutional policy action. To support such action, the book explores new methods of governance of transport in dispersed and concentrated cities, new techniques for assessing transport need, ways of improving childhood mobility, guidelines for political mobilization, and norms of knowledge sharing. Drawing together leading scholars from different disciplines in Australia, Japan and China, this book provides a unique fusion of perspectives and engages with the coming needs of transport planning practitioners in both high density and dispersed cities. © 2013 Nicholas Low selection and editorial material.},

Yet despite the ubiquity of the critique, it never sticks - Americans by the scores of millions have willingly moved into sprawling developments over the past few decades. Americans find many of the more substantial criticisms of sprawl easy to ignore because they often come across as snobbish in tone. Yet as this book explains, sprawl does create real, measurable social problems. This book is unique in two important ways. First, while it highlights the deleterious effects of sprawl on civic life in America, it is also evenhanded. The book does not dismiss the pastoral, homeowning ideal that is at the root of sprawl, and is sympathetic to the vast numbers of Americans who very clearly prefer it. Secondly, the book's critique is neither aesthetic nor moralistic in tone, but based on social science. Utilizing a landmark 30,000-person survey, the book shows that sprawl fosters civic disengagement, accentuates inequality, and negatively impacts the environment. © 2010 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

	abstract = {The decarbonisation agenda is placing increasing pressure on retailers to directly and indirectly influence greenhouse gas emissions associated with full supply chains. Transportation by sea is an important and significant element of these supply chains, yet the emissions associated with shipping, particularly international shipping, are often poorly accounted for. The magnitude of emissions embodied in a product is directly related to the distances involved in globalised product chains, where shipping can represent the most emission intensive stage per tonne of goods transported. Specifically, limited choice of ship type and size within assessment tools negates a fair estimate of product chain emissions. To address this, the correlation between ship emissions and size is quantified for a sample of United Kingdom (UK) port callings to estimate typical UK emission factors by ship type and size and to determine how well existing global data and available databases represent UK shipping activity. The results highlight that although ship type is a crucial determinant of emissions, vessel size is also important, particularly for smaller ships where the variance in emission factors is greatest. Existing, globally averaged data correlating ship size with emissions agree well with the UK data. However, the relatively higher proportion of smaller ships satisfying a UK demand for short sea shipping results in a skew towards higher typical emission factors, principally within the general cargo, product and chemical tanker categories. This bias is most visible when emissions per individual ship calling are estimated. Incorporating existing global correlation curves split by ship category into assessment tools would improve product chain estimates. However, user knowledge of likely ship size and type is an important prerequisite given the wide range of emission factors at the lower end of the scale, which could be a pivotal determinant in the absolute product chain emissions estimate. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that travel and tourism can have a high environmental impact and make a major contribution to climate change. It is therefore vital that ways to reduce these impacts are developed and implemented. 'Slow travel' provides such a concept, drawing on ideas from the 'slow food' movement with a concern for locality, ecology and quality of life. The aim of this book is to define slow travel and to discuss how some underlining values are likely to pervade new forms of sustainable development. It also aims to provide insights into the travel experience; these are explored in several chapters which bring new knowledge about sustainable transport tourism from across the world. In order to do this the book explores the concept of slow travel and sets out its core ingredients, comparing it with related frameworks such as low-carbon tourism and sustainable tourism development. The authors explain slow travel as holiday travel where air and car transport is rejected in favour of more environmentally benign forms of overland transport, which generally take much longer and become incorporated as part of the holiday experience. The book critically examines the key trends in tourism transport and recent climate change debates, setting out the main issues facing tourism planners. It reviews the potential for new consumption patterns, as well as current business models that facilitate hyper-mobility. This provides a cutting edge critique of the 'upstream' drivers to unsustainable tourism. Finally, the authors illustrate their approach through a series of case studies from around the world, featuring travel by train, bus, cycling and walking. Examples are drawn from Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas. Cases include the Eurostar train (as an alternative to air travel), walking in the Appalachian Trail (US), the Euro-Velo network of long-distance cycling routes, canoe tours on the Gudena River in Denmark, sea kayaking in British Columbia (Canada) and the Oz Bus Europe to Australia. © Janet Dickinson and Leslie Lumsdon, 2010.

	abstract = {Climate change is one of the single most important global environmental issues facing the world today and is emerging as a major topic in tourism studies. Tourism is one of the world’s largest industries; it both contributes to, and will be notably affected by, climate change. Given the emerging global legal frameworks to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses, growing costs of carbon and pro-environmentally orientated customers, carbon management in tourism is a necessity. Tourism must take responsive actions to enable travel and tourism to deliver the peak experiences that tourists seek with a lower carbon footprint. Carbon Management in Tourism is the first book devoted to carbon emission reductions and to showcase a wide range of practical mitigation measures. This book provides a comprehensive overview by combining theory and practice of climate change mitigation in global tourism, addressing various levels of scale, such as global, national, and regional tourism systems, as well as individual tourism businesses. It integrates a thorough scientific discussion of the causes of emissions growth, along with an analysis of the major options to reduce emissions, and state-of-the-art carbon management practices. Detailed case studies provide examples of tourism businesses or destinations that have successfully reduced emissions of greenhouse gasses, with consideration of economic and socio-cultural issues integrated throughout. This timely and important volume is essential reading for undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as academic researchers interested in Tourism, Environmental Management, Geography and Carbon Management. © 2011 Stefan Gössling.},

Through direct observation and interviews and using two types of city networks that have been treated separately in the literature, she discovers the structure and logic pertaining to office networks of environmental non-governmental organizations and environmental consultancy firms. In doing so she incisively demonstrates the ways in which cities fulfill the role of strategic sites of global environmental governance, concentrating knowledge, infrastructure, and institutions vital to the function of transnational actors.; As a result of global dynamics-the increasing interconnection of people and places-innovations in global environmental governance haved altered the role of cities in shaping the future of the planet.

	abstract = {This timely book provides a thorough introduction to the inter-relationship of food and the environment. Its primary purpose is to bring to our attention the multiplicity of linkages and interconnections between what we eat and how this impacts on the earth’s resources. Having a better idea of the consequences of our food choices might encourage us to develop more sustainable practices of production and consumption in the decades ahead. Although human societies have, over time, brought under control a large proportion of the earth’s resources for the purpose of food production, we remain subject to the effective functioning of global ecosystem services. The author highlights the vital importance of these services and explains why we should be concerned about the depletion of freshwater resources, soil fertility decline and loss of biological diversity. The book also tackles some of the enormous challenges of our era: climate change – to which the agri-food system is both a major contributor and a vulnerable sector – and the prospect of significantly higher energy prices, arising from the peaking of oil and gas supplies which will reveal how dependent the food system has become upon cheap fossil fuels. Such challenges are likely to have significant implications for the long-term functioning of global supply chains and raise profound questions regarding the nutritional security of the world’s population. Taken together the book argues that a re-examination of the assumptions and practices underpinning the contemporary food system is urgently required. Environment and Food is a highly original, inter-disciplinary and accessible text that will be of interest to students and the wider public genuinely interested in and concerned by the state of the world’s food provisioning system. It is richly illustrated with figures and makes extensive use of boxes to highlight relevant examples. © 2012 Colin Sage.},

It examines the availability of natural resources for the production of consumption goods and services, and the environmental consequences of economic growth. The critical forms of natural capital in need of preservation given risk, uncertainty and ignorance about the future are also examined. The author provides a critical discussion of measures of sustainability. As indicators of weak sustainability, he analyses Genuine Savings and the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, also known as the Genuine Progress Indicator. Indicators of strong sustainability covered include ecological footprints, material flows, sustainability gaps and other measures, which combine the setting of environmental standards with monetary valuation. © Eric Neumayer 2010.

	abstract = {Many books on sustainability have been written in the last decade, most of them dealing with agricultural systems, communities, and general business practices. In contrast, Handbook of Sustainability for the Food Sciences presents the concept of sustainability as it applies to the food supply chain from farm to fork but with a special emphasis on processing. Structured in four sections, Handbook of Sustainability for the Food Sciences first covers the basic concepts of environmental sustainability and provides a detailed account of all the impacts of the food supply chain. Part two introduces the management principles of sustainability and the tools required to evaluate the environmental impacts of products and services as well as environmental claims and declarations. Part three looks at ways to alleviate food chain environmental impacts and includes chapters on air emissions, water and wastewater, solid waste, energy, packaging, and transportation. The final part summarizes the concepts presented in the book and looks at the measures that will be required in the near future to guarantee long term sustainability of the food supply chain. Handbook of Sustainability for the Food Sciences is aimed at food science professionals including food engineers, food scientists, product developers, managers, educators, and decision makers. It will also be of interest to students of food science. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Global climate change presents one of the most difficult problems the international community has ever faced. Recent events at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference suggest that the United Nations is not yet equipped to address the issue, and national politics reveal that, in most cases, domestic politicians have neither the political will nor the regulatory tools at their disposal to structure effective policy regimes. Against this daunting backdrop, the experiences of United States and European Union climate policy over the last two decades offers instructive lessons. The historical evolution in US and EU climate policy exemplifies how climate change has risen to the top of political agendas in divergent contexts while the spans separating US and EU climate policy to date epitomize the struggles inherent in on-going global efforts to address climate change. Neither the EU nor the US offer unqualified lessons in success, but both offer many lessons, some of which reveal successes but all of which offer opportunities to learn from social, political, and regulatory experiments. Premised on the notion that US and EU efforts to address climate change are closely linked to global climate change politics, this book explores the content and process of climate change law and policymaking in the US and the EU to reveal policy convergences and divergences, and to examine how these convergences and divergences influence the ability of the global community to structure a sustainable, effective, and equitable long-term climate strategy. © Cinnamon P.
